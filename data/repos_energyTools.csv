This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: * Russell & Norvig 2003 * Luger & Stubblefield 2004 * Poole, Mackworth & Goebel 1998 * Nilsson 1998  Kolata 1982.  Maker 2006.  Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general: Russell & Norvig 2003, pp. 2–3, who make the analogy with aeronautical engineering. McCorduck 2004, pp. 100–101, who writes that there are ""two major branches of artificial intelligence: one aimed at producing intelligent behavior regardless of how it was accomplished, and the other aimed at modeling intelligent processes found in nature, particularly human ones."" Kolata 1982, a paper in Science, which describes McCarthy's indifference to biological models. Kolata quotes McCarthy as writing: ""This is AI, so we don't care if it's psychologically real"".[19] McCarthy recently reiterated his position at the AI@50 conference where he said ""Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence"".[20].

McCorduck 2004, p. xviii.  McCorduck 2004, p. 3.  McCorduck 2004, pp. 340–400.  This is a central idea of Pamela McCorduck's Machines Who Think. She writes: ""I like to think of artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of a venerable cultural tradition.""[26] ""Artificial intelligence in one form or another is an idea that has pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized.""[27] ""Our history is full of attempts—nutty, eerie, comical, earnest, legendary and real—to make artificial intelligences, to reproduce what is the essential us—bypassing the ordinary means. Back and forth between myth and reality, our imaginations supplying what our workshops couldn't, we have engaged for a long time in this odd form of self-reproduction.""[28] She traces the desire back to its Hellenistic roots and calls it the urge to ""forge the Gods.""[29]  ""Stephen Hawking believes AI could be mankind's last accomplishment"".

In this course, we will introduce from scratch the basic concepts of the quantum circuit model (qubits, gates and measures) and use them to study some of the most important quantum algorithms and protocols, including those that can be implemented with a few qubits (BB84, quantum teleportation, superdense coding...) as well as those that require multi-qubit systems (Deutsch-Jozsa, Grover, Shor..). We will also cover some of the most recent applications of quantum computing in the fields of optimization and simulation (with special emphasis on the use of quantum annealing, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and the variational quantum eigensolver) and quantum machine learning (for instance, through the use of quantum support vector machines and quantum variational classifiers). We will also give examples of how these techniques can be used in chemistry simulations and high energy physics problems.  The focus of the course will be on the practical aspects of quantum computing and on the implementation of algorithms in quantum simulators and actual quantum computers (as the ones available on the IBM Quantum Experience and D-Wave Leap).

This work is based on the use of convolutional neural networks to extract saliency maps for large and dense 3D scanned models. The network is trained with saliency maps extracted by fusing local and global spectral characteristics. Extensive evaluation studies carried out using various 3D models, include visual perception evaluation in simplification and compression use cases. As a result, they verify the superiority of our approach as compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

The object returns a tiny part of the wave's energy to a dish or antenna which is usually located at the same site as the transmitter. The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defense systems, antimissile systems ;marine radar start locate landmarks and other ships; aircraft anti-collision systems; ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems; meteorological precipitation monitoring; altimetry and flight control systems; guided missile target locating systems; and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations.

energy measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/Piruz-m/Smart-Weather-Station,Piruz-m/Smart-Weather-Station,"Smart Weather Station   Introduction: Weather plays an important part in our day to day life and activities. Hence, arises the need to monitor and forecast the weather. A lot of TV and radio channels, hence provide data like temperature and humidity, from weather stations installed around the area of interest. However, these stations give only general data and are never area specific. Hence, a home based weather station, would give real time and area specific weather condition reports. This is especially useful for laboratories, where the experiments are affected by any changes in the weather. A lot of personal weather stations are available in the market, but they are expensive to buy and to maintain. From a short market analysis, it is noted that the wireless weather stations are even more expensive. The stations aren’t energy efficient. All of this combined, may prove a huge economic burden, for someone requiring local weather data. Construction: To combat these problems, a personal weather station is built, on the Arduino development board, using cheap sensors, like the DHT 11 temperature and humidity sensor, the HC04 ultrasonic sensor, an ldr, the BMP280 pressure sensor and a thermistor (for detection of fluctuation in temperature). Other components in the project include, Arduino Uno development board, an active buzzer, 1 small and 1 big breadboard, HC05 Bluetooth module, 2 NPN 2n2222 transistors, a potentiometer, a 16x 2LCD display, resistors, 1 capacitor, an active buzzer, jumper cables and wires. Working and applications: When power is supplied to the Arduino Uno, the setup begins sensing data, from the environment. When an object is brought in front of the ultrasonic sensor, first the text(at 97 cm) and then the led(at 47 cm) of the LCD display is turned on. The distance between sensor and object is made more accurate, by feedback, from the DHT11 sensor. The led turns on, with a beep sound, from the active buzzer, which acts as an object detector of sorts as well. The ldr measures the light intensity in LUX, which can be used to derive the overhead cloud cover, etc. and also controls the brightness of led of LCD display, through 4 modes of brightness, according to the ambient light. The thermistor is kept slightly separate, from the general apparatus, via wire extensions, which helps analyze data such as rate of heating/cooling and change in temperature in a certain period of time, of the ambient air, or any other substance. The LCD display, displays basic data such as temperature and relative humidity.  The Bluetooth module, is used to transmit data, such as light intensity, distance between object and ultrasonic sensor, air pressure, Change in Temperature, rate of change of temperature, humidity, humiture(Heat index) and dew point to any Bluetooth receiver, such as a mobile phone.  A Bluetooth transmitter, connected to the module, can also be used as a remote to turn on the text and led, for some time, when not in range of ultrasonic sensor, or to turn the led off, when in range. On a grander scale, the setup could even be used to automate homes, by controlling the lights, garden sprinklers, indoor thermostat, etc. ,based on the empirical data collected. Conclusion: In conclusion, this setup would prove very useful to any layman- wanting to know about local weather conditions, casual hobbyists- desiring empirical data from various sensors, scientists desiring data to conduct experiments, anyone desiring to automate their home- based on the weather conditions, Students or weather scientists- who want to analyze the local weather trends. All of this, in an economical manner, that’s made energy efficient, through automation, using various cheap sensors, readily available in the market.",,2020-06-25T01:41:52Z,2025-02-28T15:12:47Z,5,4,4,,1,0

energy measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/lokyGit/ionosphere-signals-prediction,lokyGit/ionosphere-signals-prediction,"This project is about analyzing Ionosphere data and measuring the accuracies of the electromagnetic signal data. The radar statistics were gathered by an arrangement in Goose Bay, Labrador. This system involves a phased array of 16 high-frequency transmitters with an aggregate transferred power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts. Expected waves were handled by exercising an autocorrelation function whose arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number. There were 17 pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system. Two attributes per pulse number describe instances in this database. This dataset describes high-frequency antenna returns from high energy particles in the atmosphere, and whether the return shows structure or not. The problem is a binary classification that contains 351 instances and 35 numerical attributes. The majority of the data in this set are continuous data points which range between -1 and 1, with one binomial variable which defines the type of the electromagnetic signals. The objective of the project is to measure the accuracies of ‘good’ instances and ‘bad’ cases by feeding the dataset to the machine learning models mentioned below and report some of the measures to improve the overall performance of the models. Predicting the good and bad signals is very important as these signals propagate through distant places and contribute in providing better communication and help in improving the navigation. We will predict the good and bad signal results using 3 methods - KNN, GLM and decision tree and then use ensemble techniques to improve the accuracy of the model. In the ensemble technique, we will use the stacking method. We observed that generalized linear model has better classification rate among the rest and after implementing stacking technique we were able to improve the overall performance of the stacked models. Introduction Source Information: -- Donor: Vince Sigillito (vgs@aplcen.apl.jhu.edu) -- Date: 1989 -- Source: Space Physics Group, Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, MD 20723 The first 34 columns are continuous numerical data which represent 17 pulse numbers of received electromagnetic signals. There are two attributes per pulse number, which is the time of the pulse and the pulse number. The 35th column is categorical data ""good"" or ""bad"". ""good"" means those radar showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. “bad"" implies those radar does not indicate their signals pass through the ionosphere. Implementation of the Project First, we install the necessary packages and load the required libraries as mentioned below and then we read the dataset in R. We convert the last column label feature from character to factor. Next, to identify the important features we applied fitted Boruta model with the data and found out that column two i.e, V2 is not important and therefore, we removed V2 from the dataset and Created the significant dataset with important variables only. Then we split the dataset to train dataset and test dataset. Once, we have the training and test datasets we made use of knn() available in Class library for implementing KNN algorithm and glm() to implement logistic regression and rpart () to implement decision tree methods on our dataset. We chose these methods for our prediction and data analysis as we have binomial variable data with a binomial output. Because the above-mentioned algorithms perform better while dealing with categorical data points, we decided to implement the aforesaid classification methods. After completing with our modelling, we decided to improve the resulted accuracies of the models by implementing ensemble technique and we chose stacking for this case because it’s designed to combine model outputs of different types.",,2020-09-01T19:46:49Z,2024-01-16T06:42:37Z,41,3,3,R,2,0

By making some simple changes, landlords can save money on their utility bills each month.  1. Educate Tenants About Energy Conservation One of the most effective ways is to educate tenants about energy conservation. By teaching tenants about simple things like turning off lights when they leave a room or setting their thermostats a few degrees lower in the winter, landlords can help their tenants save money on their monthly utility bills.  2. Install Low-Flow Fixtures Low-flow fixtures can be installed in a variety of locations, including toilets, showers, and faucets. By installing low-flow fixtures, landlords can help their tenants to save money on their water bills. Another way to lower utility costs is to make sure that the property is well-insulated. This will help to reduce the amount of heat that is lost through the walls and ceilings.  3. Educate Tenants About Water Conservation Water conservation is important for a number of reasons. First, it can help to reduce the strain on local water resources. In many areas of the country, water resources are already under stress due to population growth and climate change. By conserving water, landlords can help to reduce the demand on these resources. Second, water conservation can save landlords money.  4. Use Smart Thermostats Smart thermostats can be programmed to automatically adjust the temperature in a space based on the time of day and the occupants&#39; needs. This can lead to significant savings on heating and cooling costs. Another way to lower utility costs is  to make sure the building is well-insulated. This will help to keep the indoor temperature more consistent, which can reduce the need for heating and cooling.  5. Educate Tenants About Recycling Recycling can help to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfill sites, and it can also help to reduce the amount of energy that is required to process and dispose of waste. Another way in which landlords can lower utility costs is by encouraging tenants to use energy-efficient appliances and lighting.  6. Use LED Lighting LED lights are much more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs, and they also last much longer. This means that landlords can save money on both their energy bills and their maintenance costs. LED lights are available in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors, so landlords can find the perfect fit for their needs. They can also be used in a variety of settings, both indoors and outdoors.  7. Educate Tenants About Storm Water Runoff Storm water runoff is a major source of water pollution, so it is important for landlords to take measures to reduce it. There are a few things tenants can do to reduce storm water runoff: Use a rain barrel or cistern to collect rainwater for watering plants or washing cars. Direct downspouts away from the foundation of the house to reduce the amount of water that seeps into the basement or crawl space.  8. Use Energy Efficient Appliances There are many ways landlords can lower utility costs for their tenants. One way is to install energy efficient appliances. Energy efficient appliances use less electricity and water, which can lower utility bills. Another way to lower utility costs is to insulate the rental property. Insulation helps to keep the heat in during the winter and the cool air in during the summer. This can help to lower heating and cooling costs.  Conclusion By following these 8 tips, landlords can easily lower their utility costs without making any significant changes to their properties. These tips are easy to implement and can save landlords a significant amount of money on their monthly utility bills. For  effortless cloud-based property management, Pickspace is a reliable software that helps you automate and optimize your business operations.",,2022-09-03T09:33:56Z,2024-10-16T17:25:29Z,2,2,2,,0,0

Organisations today are shifting towards adopting circular economy and engaging in sustainable practices that are environment friendly. In the fifth episode of PwC’s ‘ESG: A bridge to action’, in association with Moneycontrol, leaders deliberate upon the concept of circular economy and its impact on the long-term ESG goals of organisations.   Shivanshu Chauhan, Partner, ESG – Circular Economy, PwC India, and Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur India, were the guests who discussed circular economy and its impact in detail. Dr Rupinder Singh Sodhi, Managing Director, GCMMF (Amul), in an exclusive message before the beginning of the episode, reiterated the importance for organisations to be energy efficient and sustainable. Citing the example of dairy plants, Dr Sodhi said that such plants are capable of producing biogas and bio-fertilisers. He also said that manufacturing processes should be environmentally sustainable as all products nowadays undergo the scrutiny of sustainability, which will eventually become the measurement of efficient manufacturing practices in future.  Explaining circular economy and its relationship with ESG, Shivanshu Chauhan said that unlike linear economy in which a lot of resources are utilised and a significant amount of wastage is generated, circular economy minimises waste generation and maximises value creation, leading to reduced extraction of resources and more increased reusing/recycling of materials. With policy and regulatory measures on circular economy gradually being developed and implemented, and conversations about the subject becoming mainstream, organisations are able to focus better on their ESG goals. The pressures of finite resources and shifting demographics faced by organisations can be addressed by shifting to circular economy aided by technology, and PwC’s ESG services can assist them during the transition.  Discussing the incorporation of circular economy in Dabur’s operations, Mohit Malhotra said that the organisation is committed to waste management and recycling, and believes in the larger agenda of being responsible towards the planet and not merely adhering to ESG regulations. Dabur aims to become a plastic waste neutral organisation in 2022 and plans to recycle the 22,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste it generates every year.  Mohit Malhotra also reiterated the importance of involving communities for an organisation’s successful transition to ESG. Citing the example of Dabur, he said that the company ran a plastic waste management programme which is now operational across 27 states. Pilot projects are a good way of executing such ideas and addressing operational loopholes, if any. Working directly with stakeholders as well as organisations like PwC which provide ESG services have ensured a smooth and sustainable ESG transition.  Deliberating upon the cost aspect of ESG transition, Shivanshu Chauhan said that sustainability should be seen from the lens of value and not cost. The social, environmental and future cost of ESG transition should be considered and circularity creates more value for stakeholders, making them more resilient. From prioritising inputs to recycling and reusing waste, corporates today are doing more responsible and sustainable business. While there may be a significant cost involved in ESG transition, corporates should look at it from the perspective of long-term value.  Mohit Malhotra also identified consumer behaviour as a critical enabler of ESG. Urban Indian millennials and centennials are buying sustainable products to encourage corporates’ sustainability efforts. However, the real challenge would be to cater to the rural consumers at the bottom of the pyramid. India’s ESG transformation would only be possible on a larger scale when both rural and urban consumers help corporates in their sustainability journey.  Consumer acceptance as well as a functional return-on-investment (RoI) structure play important roles in a circular economy. Products and services that provide environmental, social and economic benefits will find more traction with improvement in the spending capacity of consumers and an improved understanding of sustainability.

Energy audits are conducted to identify the potential for energy efficiency measures and cost savings by investigating and thoroughly analyzing the energy (and water) entering and leaving a building. Finding activities that will result in energy and cost savings is the primary goal of the energy audit. Other destinations: lowering carbon dioxide emissions enhanced environmental conditions for the building's residents.   A systematic, documented verification process of objectively acquiring and analyzing Energy Audit evidence, in compliance with energy audit standards and followed by communication of result to the client,"" is what an energy audit is. The verification, monitoring, and analysis of energy use, as well as the production of a technical report with suggestions for increasing energy efficiency, cost-benefit research, and an action plan to reduce particular energy consumption. According to the current European legislation, you must do a regulatory energy audit with Energy Consultant when you purchase a commercial or industrial facility. This diagnosis' primary objective is to assess the buildings' energy efficiency. The building energy audit adheres to a systematic procedure that is outlined in a set of specifications. A thorough building inventory is done by Energy Auditor before the energy audit starts. An energy assessment and recommendations to increase the site's energy efficiency follow these. The energy audit's final function is to estimate the cost of any planned equipment purchases or renovations. The ADEME has outlined the essential procedures for an energy audit (French Environment and Energy Management Agency). They are covered by specifications created to help experts make decisions. 1. Evaluation of the structure The expert gathers all the information required for the energy audit before inspecting the facility. An overview of the building's energy usage is the objective. It provides a chance to create the initial concepts for improvement. 2. Data synopsis The expert can calculate the house's energy losses using a thermal camera. He also creates an initial report using pre-existing papers (invoice, technical data sheet, DPE, etc.). The thermal study serves as the foundation for developing an improvement strategy. 3. The initiative to improve energy efficiency or renovate buildings Depending on the Energy Consultant 's findings, the expert decides on a renovation plan or action plan. This entails creating many scenarios to lower the energy consumption of the buildings. 4. Displaying the audit report Your service provider will then provide comprehensive information that includes all the building-related data gathered during the audit phase, their specifics, a complete heat balance, a list of the various improvement scenarios envisioned, and an overview of all potential solutions in order of relevance.",,2022-10-05T10:47:25Z,2022-10-05T10:47:25Z,0,0,0,,0,0

The objective of this  study was to develop a statistical regression model to predict in vivo body fat percentage (dual energy X‐ray) in men and women across significant age and obesity ranges.   Methods This study included 228 adults between the ages of 21 and 70, with BMI between 18.5 and 40.0 kg m−2.  The study population was split into training (n = 163) and validation (n = 65) groups, which were used to develop and validate the prediction models.

The vacuum is described very differently in the quantum mechanical context than in the classical context. Traditionally, a vacuum is considered as a space that is empty of matter or photons. Quantum mechanically, however, that same space resembles a sea of virtual particles appearing and disappearing all the time. This result is due to the fact that the vacuum still possesses a zero-point energy. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the vacuum exhibits random fluctuations in phase and amplitude at all frequencies.

The copy-paste method saves a lot of time and energy and helps spread good coding practices and patterns. However, if a bug is detected, then all the replicated codes should be checked for the same bug. A clone detection tool is required to save time and energy, and ease the process of reusing source code between software developers. The tool also detects the clones across singular or multiple projects, which eases the process of fixing bugs and overall software maintenance. The main purpose of this paper is to gain insight into the research available in the area of clone detection and management, as well as identify the research gaps to work upon. Despite a decade of active research, there is a noticeable lack of clone detectors that measure to very large repositories of source code, specifically for detecting near-miss clones where noteworthy-editing activities may take place in the cloned code. This paper presents a token-based clone detection tool that targets all the clone types using Python Sequence Matcher that is tested to detect clones across a single project, as well as across multiple projects using different data sets. The output of the tool has shown the correct detection of cloned methods whether they are syntactically identical, similar or dissimilar clones across a project or several projects according to a preset threshold.

Ireland, however, is trailing in its target to meet the carbon reduction standards set by the European Union that must be met by 2020. Ideal locations to set up solar farms is a boon when calculating the amount of investment required to harness the photovoltaic potential of the area. This project utilized CAMS-Radiation Service solar irradiance measures (global, direct, and diffuse) under normal and clear-sky conditions to detect ideal locations with photovoltaic potential for 26 counties in Ireland. A combination of k-means clustering with support vector machine(SVM) and a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) was used to detect ideal locations, which resulted in a detection rate of 99%. The seasonal approach towards location detection provided better location detection rates in summer (SVM-95% and GBDT-98%) with autumn (SVM-94%, GBDT-96%) providing the lowest. This can help electricity firms in Ireland, such as the Electricity Supply Board, to plan, invest and strategize immeasurably while setting up solar farms or domestic installations.","bms,dbscan-clustering,gbdt,kmeans-clustering,mean-shift,r,random-forest,solar-irradiance,svm-classifier",2019-05-07T17:33:37Z,2019-05-08T10:28:14Z,9,0,0,R,0,0

But for physicists, discovering a new particle means the beginning of a long and challenging quest to measure its characteristics and determine if it fits the current model of nature.  A vital property of any particle is how often it decays into other particles. ATLAS is a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that searches for new particles and processes using head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy. The ATLAS experiment has recently observed a signal of the Higgs boson decaying into two tau particles, but this decay is a small signal buried in background noise.  The goal of the Higgs Boson Machine Learning project is to explore the potential of advanced machine learning methods to improve the discovery significance of the experiment. No knowledge of particle physics is required. Using simulated data with features characterizing events detected by ATLAS, your task is to classify events into ""tau decay of a Higgs boson"" versus ""background.""",,2021-09-03T13:59:10Z,2021-09-03T14:01:10Z,17,0,0,,0,0

In this paper [1], it is formulated and focused on two pairs of problems that aim to find an edge coloring of a graph so as to minimize the reload and changeover costs. The first pair of problems aims to find a proper edge coloring so that the reload/changeover cost of a set of paths is minimized. The second pair of problems aim to find a proper edge coloring and a spanning tree so that the reload/changeover cost is minimized. In this study, it is aimed to design algorithms to find a suitable edge color and an spanning tree in order to reduce the reload cost which is the second problem of the pair, and to compare it with random coloring and reload costs with an spanning tree finding algorithm and the designed algorithm will give good results.",,2018-10-03T19:24:15Z,2018-10-03T20:06:05Z,6518,0,0,Java,0,0

Hence, you’re starting your earth-saving challenge by writing a tool that can estimate the power draw of a single dimmable smart light bulb. When fully lit, the light consumes 5W, and this then drops linearly as the dimmer is turned down. Internally, the light represents its dimmer value as a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The light outputs a message whenever someone adjusts it. Each message contains a timestamp from the light bulb’s internal clock (in seconds since the start of 1970). There are two types of messages. A TurnOff message indicates that the light has been turned off completely. A Delta message indicates that the brightness has been adjusted; it includes a value for the change in the dimmer value (a floating point number between -1.0 and +1.0 inclusive). Your tool consumes these messages, estimates the dimmer value over time, and uses that to estimate the energy consumed by the light. But there is a catch.

It investigates a wide range of physics, from the search for the Higgs boson to extra dimensions and particles that could make up dark matter. The ATLAS detector consists of a series of ever-larger concentric cylinders around the interaction point where the proton beams from the LHC collide. It can be divided into four major sections: Τhe Inner Detector, the innermost component, tracks the motion of charged particles as they move away from the interaction point. The tracks measured by recording particle/detector interactions at a multitude of discrete points, form the first step in identifying the unknown particles. The calorimeters measure the energy of both neutral and charged particles by interacting with them, resulting in creating cascades of secondary particles. The Muon Spectrometer, the outermost component of the detector, makes additional measurements of highly penetrating muons, which are capable of passing through the inner layers without interaction. Finally, the magnet systems bend charged particles in the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer; their direction of motion and degree of curvature become indicative of their charge and momentum, respectively.  The detector generates unmanageably large amounts of raw data: about 25 megabytes per event, multiplied by 40 million beam crossings per second in the center of the detector, producing a total of 1 petabyte of raw data per second. Thus, a trigger system is needed in order to select potentially interesting events for storage in real-time, so as to avoid being overwhelmed by background processes. The ATLAS trigger system uses simple information to identify the most interesting events to retain for detailed analysis. The data acquisition system receives and buffers the event data from the detector-specific readout electronics. Grid computing is being extensively used for event reconstruction, allowing the parallel use of computer networks throughout the world. A major problem at the ATLAS detector is the huge radiation background, coming from the collisions at the interaction point. This background causes several problems such as radiation damage to silicon detectors and readout electronics, ageing of the subdetectors, radiation deposits that disrupt electronic signals or destroy components, and background signals resulting in spurious and random triggers. For the limitation of these consequences, ATLAS uses almost 3000 tonnes of shielding in a multilayer design, taking advantage of the absorbing capacities of different materials.","atlas,atlas-detector,cern,data-analysis,matlab,monte-carlo,monte-carlo-simulations,trigger",2017-07-18T14:27:56Z,2021-12-12T05:31:08Z,8902,0,0,,0,0

So let’s find out a few tips and tricks that will help to extend the lifespan of your laptop battery life.  Dim the screen By far, it is the biggest reason which drains power on most laptops is the screen. This is what enables you to see the colors on an LCD screen, and some older laptops have power-sapping fluorescent backlights. Modern laptops have LED backlights, but even these use a fair amount of juice. Always use brightness less than 60% it will add more 30 minutes to your battery life.  Virtually all laptops have keyboard shortcuts to adjust the brightness. To set manually increase or decrease the sun symbol button on the top.     Keep it cool It’s essential to keep it cool, avoid using on the pillow; this kind of activity is categorized under brutal usage of the laptop. Pillow restricts to pass air; as a result, your laptop started getting heat. Therefore, your battery starting to lose its capacity.     Switch off Wi-Fi One of the biggest reasons is the continuation of the Wi-Fi network built into modern laptops. Wi-Fi drains the battery by continually utilizing power from the battery and, when not connected, searching for networks. Turn it on manually and switch it off when not needed. This will save sufficient energy of your battery, and as a result, it will avoid overheating.  When you're using your laptop search for network and connect it down but when you are not using Wi-Fi, switch it off from settings option.  Apart from these measures make sure you update the latest software along with new apps update in Store.  The life of your battery depends on an individual’s usage; it will respond you back the way you use. When you observe or analyze by applying these steps, still you do not get enough juice to power it up, then the only option left is to change your battery.  Always buy original battery from the authorized store.  What are you thinking? Start applying these tricks from today!",,2019-05-28T11:53:40Z,2019-05-28T11:53:40Z,0,0,0,,0,1

energy measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/PwCIndia2/Understanding-circular-economy-a-key-ESG-imperative,PwCIndia2/Understanding-circular-economy-a-key-ESG-imperative,"The ways in which businesses function and execute their operations have changed as the global economy has undergone major transformations in the past few years. Organisations today are shifting towards adopting circular economy and engaging in sustainable practices that are environment friendly. In the fifth episode of PwC’s ‘ESG: A bridge to action’, in association with Moneycontrol, leaders deliberate upon the concept of circular economy and its impact on the long-term ESG goals of organisations.   Shivanshu Chauhan, Partner, ESG – Circular Economy, PwC India, and Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur India, were the guests who discussed circular economy and its impact in detail. Dr Rupinder Singh Sodhi, Managing Director, GCMMF (Amul), in an exclusive message before the beginning of the episode, reiterated the importance for organisations to be energy efficient and sustainable. Citing the example of dairy plants, Dr Sodhi said that such plants are capable of producing biogas and bio-fertilisers. He also said that manufacturing processes should be environmentally sustainable as all products nowadays undergo the scrutiny of sustainability, which will eventually become the measurement of efficient manufacturing practices in future.  Explaining circular economy and its relationship with ESG, Shivanshu Chauhan said that unlike linear economy in which a lot of resources are utilised and a significant amount of wastage is generated, circular economy minimises waste generation and maximises value creation, leading to reduced extraction of resources and more increased reusing/recycling of materials. With policy and regulatory measures on circular economy gradually being developed and implemented, and conversations about the subject becoming mainstream, organisations are able to focus better on their ESG goals. The pressures of finite resources and shifting demographics faced by organisations can be addressed by shifting to circular economy aided by technology, and PwC’s ESG services can assist them during the transition.  Discussing the incorporation of circular economy in Dabur’s operations, Mohit Malhotra said that the organisation is committed to waste management and recycling, and believes in the larger agenda of being responsible towards the planet and not merely adhering to ESG regulations. Dabur aims to become a plastic waste neutral organisation in 2022 and plans to recycle the 22,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste it generates every year.  Mohit Malhotra also reiterated the importance of involving communities for an organisation’s successful transition to ESG. Citing the example of Dabur, he said that the company ran a plastic waste management programme which is now operational across 27 states. Pilot projects are a good way of executing such ideas and addressing operational loopholes, if any. Working directly with stakeholders as well as organisations like PwC which provide ESG services have ensured a smooth and sustainable ESG transition.  Deliberating upon the cost aspect of ESG transition, Shivanshu Chauhan said that sustainability should be seen from the lens of value and not cost. The social, environmental and future cost of ESG transition should be considered and circularity creates more value for stakeholders, making them more resilient. From prioritising inputs to recycling and reusing waste, corporates today are doing more responsible and sustainable business. While there may be a significant cost involved in ESG transition, corporates should look at it from the perspective of long-term value.  Mohit Malhotra also identified consumer behaviour as a critical enabler of ESG. Urban Indian millennials and centennials are buying sustainable products to encourage corporates’ sustainability efforts. However, the real challenge would be to cater to the rural consumers at the bottom of the pyramid. India’s ESG transformation would only be possible on a larger scale when both rural and urban consumers help corporates in their sustainability journey.  Consumer acceptance as well as a functional return-on-investment (RoI) structure play important roles in a circular economy. Products and services that provide environmental, social and economic benefits will find more traction with improvement in the spending capacity of consumers and an improved understanding of sustainability.

They'll make a suit from your freshly                           peeled skin.                                        MEN                          No!                                       SHREK                          They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the                           jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's                           quite good on toast.                                        MAN1                          Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!                           (waves the torch at Shrek.)                  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The                 men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long                 and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the                 men are in the dark.                                        SHREK                          This is the part where you run away.                           (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)                           And stay out! (looks down and picks                           up a piece of paper. Reads.) ""Wanted.                           Fairy tale creatures.""(He sighs and                           throws the paper over his shoulder.)                                            THE NEXT DAY                 There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard                 sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures                 to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line                 are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto                 who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three                 little pigs.

Your flying days are over. (breaks the                           broom in half)                                        HEAD GUARD                          That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch.                           Next!                                        GUARD                          Get up! Come on!

Give me another chance!                                        OLD WOMAN                          Oh, shut up.

Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up                 to the table.                                        HEAD GUARD                          Next! What have you got?                                       OLD WOMAN                          Well, I've got a talking donkey.                                       HEAD GUARD                          Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings,                           if you can prove it.                                        OLD WOMAN                          Oh, go ahead, little fella.                 Donkey just looks up at her.                                       HEAD GUARD                          Well?                                       OLD WOMAN                          Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little                           nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.                           Talk, you boneheaded dolt...                                        HEAD GUARD                          That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!                                                                  OLD WOMAN                          No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends                           to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to                           talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing                           you ever saw.                                        HEAD GUARD                          Get her out of my sight.                                       OLD WOMAN                          No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!                 The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One                 of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's                 hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled                 with fairy dust and he's able to fly.                                        DONKEY                          Hey! I can fly!                                       PETER PAN                          He can fly!                                       3 LITTLE PIGS                          He can fly!                                       HEAD GUARD                          He can talk!                                       DONKEY                          Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm                           a flying, talking donkey. You might                           have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly                           but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey                           fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins                           to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink                           to the ground.)                  He hits the ground with a thud.                                       HEAD GUARD                          Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.)                           After him!                                        GUARDS                          He's getting away! Get him! This way!                           Turn!                  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.                 Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared                 for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He                 quickly hides behind Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          You there. Ogre!                                       SHREK                          Aye?                                       HEAD GUARD                          By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized                           to place you both under arrest and transport                           you to a designated resettlement facility.                                                                  SHREK                          Oh, really? You and what army?                 He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well                 and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail                 and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and                 begins walking back to his cottage.                                        DONKEY                          Can I say something to you? Listen,                           you was really, really, really somethin'                           back here. Incredible!                                        SHREK                          Are you talkin' to...(he turns around                           and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back                           around and Donkey is right in front                           of him.) Whoa!                                        DONKEY                          Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell                           you that you that you was great back                           here? Those guards! They thought they                           was all of that. Then you showed up,                           and bam! They was trippin' over themselves                           like babes in the woods. That really                           made me feel good to see that.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that's great. Really.                                       DONKEY                          Man, it's good to be free.                                       SHREK                          Now, why don't you go celebrate your                           freedom with your own friends? Hmm?                                                                  DONKEY                          But, uh, I don't have any friends. And                           I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey,                           wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll                           stick with you. You're mean, green,                           fightin' machine. Together we'll scare                           the spit out of anybody that crosses                           us.                  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very                 loudly.                                        DONKEY                          Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you                           don't mind me sayin', if that don't                           work, your breath certainly will get                           the job done, 'cause you definitely                           need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause                           you breath stinks! You almost burned                           the hair outta my nose, just like the                           time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey                           continues to talk, so Shrek removes                           his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten                           berries. I had strong gases leaking                           out of my butt that day.

DONKEY                          Really, really.                                       SHREK                          Oh.                                       DONKEY                          Man, I like you. What's you name?                                       SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek? Well, you know what I like about                           you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me                           thing. I like that. I respect that,                           Shrek. You all right. (They come over                           a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.)                           Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live                           in place like that?                                        SHREK                          That would be my home.                                       DONKEY                          Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.                           You know you are quite a decorator.                           It's amazing what you've done with such                           a modest budget. I like that boulder.                           That is a nice boulder. I guess you                           don't entertain much, do you?                                        SHREK                          I like my privacy.                                       DONKEY                          You know, I do too. That's another thing                           we have in common. Like I hate it when                           you got somebody in your face. You've                           trying to give them a hint, and they                           won't leave. There's that awkward silence.                           (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, what?                                       DONKEY                          Can I stay with you, please?                                       SHREK                          (sarcastically) Of course!                                       DONKEY                          Really?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Please! I don't wanna go back there!                           You don't know what it's like to be                           considered a freak. (pause while he                           looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.                           But that's why we gotta stick together.                           You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!                                                                  SHREK                          Okay! Okay! But one night only.                                       DONKEY                          Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)                                                                  SHREK                          What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto                           a chair.) No! No!                                        DONKEY                          This is gonna be fun! We can stay up                           late, swappin' manly stories, and in                           the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                                       DONKEY                          Where do, uh, I sleep?                                       SHREK                          (irritated) Outside!                                       DONKEY                          Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean,                           I don't know you, and you don't know                           me, so I guess outside is best, you                           know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek                           slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do                           like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was                           born outside. I'll just be sitting by                           myself outside, I guess, you know. By                           myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's                           no one here beside me...                  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                 Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights                 a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a                 noise. He stands up with a huff.                                        SHREK                          (to Donkey) I thought I told you to                           stay outside.                                        DONKEY                          (from the window) I am outside.                 There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that                 made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns                 and spots 3 blind mice on his table.                                        BLIND MOUSE1                          Well, gents, it's a far cry from the                           farm, but what choice do we have?                                                                  BLIND MOUSE2                          It's not home, but it'll do just fine.                                                                  GORDO                          (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.                                                                  SHREK                          Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes                           and lands on his shoulder.)                                        GORDO                          I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's                           ear)                                        SHREK                          Ow!                                       GORDO                          Blah! Awful stuff.                                       BLIND MOUSE1                          Is that you, Gordo?                                       GORDO                          How did you know?                                       SHREK                          Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are                           you doing in my house? (He gets bumped                           from behind and he drops the mice.)                           Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves                           with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,                           no, no. Dead broad off the table.                                                                  DWARF                          Where are we supposed to put her? The                           bed's taken.                                        SHREK                          Huh?                 Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.                 The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at                 him.                                        BIG BAD WOLF                          What?                 TIME LAPSE                 Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging                 him to the front door.                                        SHREK                          I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm                           a terrifying ogre! What do I have to                           do get a little privacy? (He opens the                           front door to throw the Wolf out and                           he sees that all the collected Fairy                           Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,                           no. No! No!                  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his                 pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing                 flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.                                                        SHREK                          What are you doing in my swamp? (this                           echoes and everyone falls silent.)                                            Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a                 tent.                                        SHREK                          All right, get out of here. All of you,                           move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!                           Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more                           dwarves run inside the house) No, no!                           No, no. Not there. Not there. (they                           shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to                           look at Donkey)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite                           them.                                        PINOCCHIO                          Oh, gosh, no one invited us.                                       SHREK                          What?                                       PINOCCHIO                          We were forced to come here.                                       SHREK                          (flabbergasted) By who?                                       LITTLE PIG                          Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed                           and he...signed an eviction notice.                                                                  SHREK                          (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where                           this Farquaad guy is?                  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, I do. I know where he is.                                       SHREK                          Does anyone else know where to find                           him? Anyone at all?                                        DONKEY                          Me! Me!                                       SHREK                          Anyone?                                       DONKEY                          Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know!                           Me, me!                                        SHREK                          (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy                           tale things. Do not get comfortable.                           Your welcome is officially worn out.                           In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad                           right now and get you all off my land                           and back where you came from! (Pause.                           Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)                           You! You're comin' with me.                                        DONKEY                          All right, that's what I like to hear,                           man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart                           friends, off on a whirlwind big-city                           adventure. I love it!                                        DONKEY                          (singing) On the road again. Sing it                           with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get                           on the road again.                                        SHREK                          What did I say about singing?                                       DONKEY                          Can I whistle?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Can I hum it?                                       SHREK                          All right, hum it.                 Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.                 DULOC - KITCHEN                 A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually                 dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.                                        FARQUAAD                          That's enough. He's ready to talk.                                            The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down                 onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the                 table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes                 up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.                                                        FARQUAAD                          (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs                           and plays with them) Run, run, run,                           as fast as you can. You can't catch                           me. I'm the gingerbread man.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          You are a monster.                                       FARQUAAD                          I'm not the monster here. You are. You                           and the rest of that fairy tale trash,                           poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell                           me! Where are the others?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's                           eye.)                                        FARQUAAD                          I've tried to be fair to you creatures.                           Now my patience has reached its end!                           Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to                           pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop                           buttons.                                        FARQUAAD                          All right then. Who's hiding them?                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the                           muffin man?                                        FARQUAAD                          The muffin man?

FARQUAAD                          Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives                           on Drury Lane?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Well, she's married to the muffin man.

FARQUAAD                          She's married to the muffin man.                 The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.                                       HEAD GUARD                          My lord! We found it.                                       FARQUAAD                          Then what are you waiting for? Bring                           it in.                  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.                 They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic                 Mirror.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          (in awe) Ohhhh...

(Farquaad picks                           him up and dumps him into a trash can                           with a lid.) No!                                        FARQUAAD                          Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall.                           Is this not the most perfect kingdom                           of them all?

MIRROR                          What I mean is you're not a king yet.                           But you can become one. All you have                           to do is marry a princess.                                        FARQUAAD                          Go on.

And here they are! Bachelorette number                           one is a mentally abused shut-in from                           a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi                           and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies                           include cooking and cleaning for her                           two evil sisters.

Although she lives                           with seven other men, she's not easy.                           Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and                           find out what a live wire she is. Come                           on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows                           picture of Snow White) And last, but                           certainly not last, bachelorette number                           three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded                           castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!                           But don't let that cool you off. She's                           a loaded pistol who likes pina colads                           and getting caught in the rain. Yours                           for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

She's perfect. All I                           have to do is just find someone who                           can go...                                        MIRROR                          But I probably should mention the little                           thing that happens at night.                                        FARQUAAD                          I'll do it.                                       MIRROR                          Yes, but after sunset...

The castle itself is about 40 stories high.                                        DONKEY                          But that's it. That's it right there.                           That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.

(He laughs, but then                           groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke.                           He continues walking through the parking                           lot.)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, wait.

(The attendant, who is wearing                           a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad,                           screams and begins running through the                           rows of rope to get to the front gate                           to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second.                           Look, I'm not gonna eat you.

Shrek and Donkey look at him then                           continue on into DuLoc.)                  DULOC                 They look around but all is quiet.

DONKEY                          Hey, look at this!                 Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box                 marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors                 open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin                 to sing.                                        WOODEN PEOPLE                          Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town                                            Here we have some rules                 Let us lay them down                 Don't make waves, stay in line                 And we'll get along fine                 DuLoc is perfect place                 Please keep off of the grass                 Shine your shoes, wipe your... face                 DuLoc is, DuLoc is                 DuLoc is perfect place.                 Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.                                       DONKEY                          Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready                           to run over and pull the lever again)                                                                  SHREK                          (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still)                           No. No. No, no, no! No.                  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.                                       FARQUAAD                          Brave knights.

As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena                 Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.                                        SHREK                          All right. You're going the right way                           for a smacked bottom.                                        DONKEY                          Sorry about that.                                       FARQUAAD                          That champion shall have the honor -                           - no, no - - the privilege to go forth                           and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona                           from the fiery keep of the dragon. If                           for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,                           the first runner-up will take his place                           and so on and so forth. Some of you                           may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing                           to make. (cheers) Let the tournament                           begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is                           that? It's hideous!                                        SHREK                          (turns to look at Donkey and then back                           at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice.                           It's just a donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who                           kills the ogre will be named champion!                           Have it him!                                        MEN                          Get him!                                       SHREK                          Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps                           into a table where there are mugs of                           beer)                                        CROWD                          Go ahead! Get him!                                       SHREK                          (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just                           settle this over a pint?                                        CROWD                          Kill the beast!                                       SHREK                          No? All right then. (drinks the beer)                           Come on!                  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel                 of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the                 other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides                 past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.                 As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger                 beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.                 Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much                 fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice                 to say that Shrek kicks butt.                                        DONKEY                          Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!                 Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek                 gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.                                        SHREK                          Yeah!                 A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time                 and sees him.                                        WOMAN                          The chair! Give him the chair!                 Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men                 are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding                 sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.                                        SHREK                          Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you                           very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try                           the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)                  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on                 Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          Shall I give the order, sir?                                       FARQUAAD                          No, I have a better idea. People of                           DuLoc, I give you our champion!                                        SHREK                          What?                                       FARQUAAD                          Congratulations, ogre. You're won the                           honor of embarking on a great and noble                           quest.                                        SHREK                          Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest                           to get my swamp back.                                        FARQUAAD                          Your swamp?                                       SHREK                          Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those                           fairy tale creatures!                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you                           a deal. Go on this quest for me, and                           I'll give you your swamp back.                                        SHREK                          Exactly the way it was?                                       FARQUAAD                          Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.                                                                  SHREK                          And the squatters?                                       FARQUAAD                          As good as gone.                                       SHREK                          What kind of quest?                 Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field                 heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.                                        DONKEY                          Let me get this straight. You're gonna                           go fight a dragon and rescue a princess                           just so Farquaad will give you back                           a swamp which you only don't have because                           he filled it full of freaks in the first                           place. Is that about right?                                        SHREK                          You know, maybe there's a good reason                           donkeys shouldn't talk.                                        DONKEY                          I don't get it. Why don't you just pull                           some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle                           him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds                           his bones to make your bread, the whole                           ogre trip.                                        SHREK                          Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have                           decapitated an entire village and put                           their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,                           cut open their spleen and drink their                           fluids. Does that sound good to you?                                                                  DONKEY                          Uh, no, not really, no.                                       SHREK                          For your information, there's a lot                           more to ogres than people think.                                        DONKEY                          Example?                                       SHREK                          Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.                           (he holds out his onion)                                        DONKEY                          (sniffs the onion) They stink?                                       SHREK                          Yes - - No!                                       DONKEY                          They make you cry?                                       SHREK                          No!                                       DONKEY                          You leave them in the sun, they get                           all brown, start sproutin' little white                           hairs.                                        SHREK                          No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres                           have layers! Onions have layers. You                           get it? We both have layers. (he heaves                           a sigh and then walks off)                                        DONKEY                          (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both                           have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know,                           not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody                           loves cakes! Cakes have layers.                                        SHREK                          I don't care... what everyone likes.                           Ogres are not like cakes.                                        DONKEY                          You know what else everybody likes?                           Parfaits. Have you ever met a person,                           you say, ""Let's get some parfait,"" they                           say, ""Hell no, I don't like no parfait""?                           Parfaits are delicious.                                        SHREK                          No! You dense, irritating, miniature                           beast of burden! Ogres are like onions!                           And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.                                                                  DONKEY                          Parfaits may be the most delicious thing                           on the whole damn planet.                                        SHREK                          You know, I think I preferred your humming.                                                                  DONKEY                          Do you have a tissue or something? I'm                           making a mess. Just the word parfait                           make me start slobbering.                  They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through                 a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying                 to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem,                 so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.                  DRAGON'S KEEP                 Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to                 house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.                                                        DONKEY                          (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?                           You gotta warn somebody before you just                           crack one off. My mouth was open and                           everything.                                        SHREK                          Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd                           be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We                           must be getting close.                                        DONKEY                          Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking                           about it's the brimstone. I know what                           I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It                           didn't come off no stone neither.                                            They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There                 is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where                 the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very                 foreboding.                                        SHREK                          Sure, it's big enough, but look at the                           location. (laughs...then the laugh turns                           into a groan)                                        DONKEY                          Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said                           ogres have layers?                                        SHREK                          Oh, aye.                                       DONKEY                          Well, I have a bit of a confession to                           make. Donkeys don't have layers. We                           wear our fear right out there on our                           sleeves.                                        SHREK                          Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.                                                                  DONKEY                          You know what I mean.                                       SHREK                          You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.                                                                  DONKEY                          No, I'm just a little uncomfortable                           about being on a rickety bridge over                           a boiling like of lava!                                        SHREK                          Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside                           ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll                           just tackle this thing together one                           little baby step at a time.                                        DONKEY                          Really?                                       SHREK                          Really, really.                                       DONKEY                          Okay, that makes me feel so much better.                                                                  SHREK                          Just keep moving.

Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't                           look down. (he steps through a rotting                           board and ends up looking straight down                           into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down!                           Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me                           off, please!                                        SHREK                          But you're already halfway.                                       DONKEY                          But I know that half is safe!

(continues to                           bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across                           the bridge)                                        DONKEY                          No, Shrek!

I'm gonna die. Shrek,                           I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground)                           Oh!                                        SHREK                          That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks                           towards the castle)                                        DONKEY                          Cool. So where is this fire-breathing                           pain-in-the-neck anyway?                                        SHREK                          Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.                           (chuckles)                                        DONKEY                          I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.                                            INSIDE THE CASTLE                                       DONKEY                          You afraid?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          But...                                       SHREK                          Shh.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton                           and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong                           with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible                           response to an unfamiliar situation.                           Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might                           add. With a dragon that breathes fire                           and eats knights and breathes fire,                           it sure doesn't mean you're a coward                           if you're a little scared. I sure as                           heck ain't no coward. I know that.                                                                  SHREK                          Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up.                           Now go over there and see if you can                           find any stairs.                                        DONKEY                          Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for                           the princess.                                        SHREK                          (putting on a helmet) The princess will                           be up the stairs in the highest room                           in the tallest tower.                                        DONKEY                          What makes you think she'll be there?                                                                  SHREK                          I read it in a book once. (walks off)                                                                  DONKEY                          Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle                           the stairs. I'll find those stairs.                           I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs                           won't know which way they're goin'.                           (walks off)                  EMPTY ROOM                 Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.                                                        DONKEY                          I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it                           to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm                           the stair master. I've mastered the                           stairs. I wish I had a step right here.                           I'd step all over it.                  ELSEWHERE                 Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.                                       SHREK                          Well, at least we know where the princess                           is, but where's the...                                        DONKEY                          (os) Dragon!                 Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again.                 Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon                 breathes fire.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, look out! (he manages to get                           a hold of the dragons tail and holds                           on) Got ya!                  The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek                 goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the                 tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying                 on the floor.                                        DONKEY                          Oh! Aah! Aah!                 Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small                 part of the bridge he's on.                                        DONKEY                          No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh,                           what large teeth you have. (the dragon                           growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth.                           I know you probably hear this all time                           from your food, but you must bleach,                           'cause that is one dazzling smile you                           got there. Do I detect a hint of minty                           freshness? And you know what else? You're                           - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure!                           I mean, of course you're a girl dragon.                           You're just reeking of feminine beauty.                           (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes                           at him) What's the matter with you?                           You got something in your eye? Ohh.                           Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay,                           but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon                           blows a smoke ring in the shape of a                           heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm                           an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd                           work out if you're gonna blow smoke                           rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him                           up with her teeth and carries him off)                           No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!                  FIONA'S ROOM                 Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona                 so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She                 then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off                 the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.                 Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for                 a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders                 and shakes her away.                                        FIONA                          Oh! Oh!

Should it not be a wonderful,                           romantic moment?                                        SHREK                          Yeah, sorry, lady.

You should                           sweep me off my feet out yonder window                           and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

FIONA                          But we have to savor this moment! You                           could recite an epic poem for me. A                           ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!                                                                  SHREK                          I don't think so.                                       FIONA                          Can I at least know the name of my champion?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       FIONA                          Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds                           out a handkerchief) I pray that you                           take this favor as a token of my gratitude.                                                                  SHREK                          Thanks!                 Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.                                       FIONA                          (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?                                                                  SHREK                          It's on my to-do list. Now come on!                           (takes off running and drags Fiona behind                           him.)                                        FIONA                          But this isn't right! You were meant                           to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.                           That's what all the other knights did.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, right before they burst into flame.                                                                  FIONA                          That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly                           stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek                           ignores her and heads for a wooden door                           off to the side.) Wait. Where are you                           going? The exit's over there.                                        SHREK                          Well, I have to save my ass.                                       FIONA                          What kind of knight are you?                                       SHREK                          One of a kind. (opens the door into                           the throne room)                                        DONKEY                          (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.                           I believe it's healthy to get to know                           someone over a long period of time.                           Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs                           worriedly) (we see him up close and                           from a distance as Shrek sneaks into                           the room) I don't want to rush into                           a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally                           ready for a commitment of, uh, this                           - - Magnitude really is the word I'm                           looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that                           is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what                           are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just                           back up a little and take this one step                           at a time. We really should get to know                           each other first as friends or pen pals.                           I'm on the road a lot, but I just love                           receiving cards - - I'd really love                           to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's                           my tail! That's my personal tail. You're                           gonna tear it off. I don't give permission                           - - What are you gonna do with that?                           Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.                           No, no, no. No! Oh!                  Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings                 toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks                 up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.                 He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps                 Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.                 Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and                 roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto                 her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms                 a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey                 take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and                 then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.                                        DONKEY                          Hi, Princess!                                       FIONA                          It talks!                                       SHREK                          Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's                           the trick.                  They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots                 a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a                 crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His                 eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles                 off and walks lightly.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                 Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.                                                        SHREK                          Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll                           take care of the dragon.                  Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the                 castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping                 chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that                 is still around the dragons neck.                                        SHREK                          (echoing) Run!                 They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot                 pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons                 breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on                 for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They                 are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look                 in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to                 get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the                 dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs                 quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a                 sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.                                        FIONA                          (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You                           did it! You rescued me! You're amazing.                           (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)                           You're - - You're wonderful. You're...                           (turns and sees Shrek fall down the                           hill and bump into Donkey) a little                           unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed                           is great, and thy heart is pure. I am                           eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears                           his throat.) And where would a brave                           knight be without his noble steed?                                                                  DONKEY                          I hope you heard that. She called me                           a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.                                                                  FIONA                          The battle is won. You may remove your                           helmet, good Sir Knight.                                        SHREK                          Uh, no.                                       FIONA                          Why not?                                       SHREK                          I have helmet hair.                                       FIONA                          Please. I would'st look upon the face                           of my rescuer.                                        SHREK                          No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.                                       FIONA                          But how will you kiss me?                                       SHREK                          What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the                           job description.                                        DONKEY                          Maybe it's a perk.                                       FIONA                          No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know                           how it goes. A princess locked in a                           tower and beset by a dragon is rescued                           by a brave knight, and then they share                           true love's first kiss.                                        DONKEY                          Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.                           Wait. You think that Shrek is you true                           love?                                        FIONA                          Well, yes.                 Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.                                       DONKEY                          You think Shrek is your true love!                                                                  FIONA                          What is so funny?                                       SHREK                          Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona:                           Of course, you are. You're my rescuer.                           Now - - Now remove your helmet.                                        SHREK                          Look. I really don't think this is a                           good idea.                                        FIONA                          Just take off the helmet.                                       SHREK                          I'm not going to.                                       FIONA                          Take it off.                                       SHREK                          No!                                       FIONA                          Now!                                       SHREK                          Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.                           (takes off his helmet)                                        FIONA                          You- - You're a- - an ogre.                                       SHREK                          Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.                                                                  FIONA                          Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is                           all wrong. You're not supposed to be                           an ogre.                                        SHREK                          Princess, I was sent to rescue you by                           Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who                           wants to marry you.                                        FIONA                          Then why didn't he come rescue me?                                                                  SHREK                          Good question. You should ask him that                           when we get there.                                        FIONA                          But I have to be rescued by my true                           love, not by some ogre and his- - his                           pet.                                        DONKEY                          Well, so much for noble steed.                                       SHREK                          You're not making my job any easier.                                                                  FIONA                          I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.                           You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he                           wants to rescue me properly, I'll be                           waiting for him right here.                                        SHREK                          Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all                           right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy.                           (he swiftly picks her up and swings                           her over his shoulder like she was a                           sack of potatoes)                                        FIONA                          You wouldn't dare. Put me down!                                       SHREK                          Ya comin', Donkey?                                       DONKEY                          I'm right behind ya.                                       FIONA                          Put me down, or you will suffer the                           consequences! This is not dignified!                           Put me down!                  WOODS                 A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just                 hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, so here's another question. Say                           there's a woman that digs you, right,                           but you don't really like her that way.                           How do you let her down real easy so                           her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't                           get burned to a crisp and eaten?                                        FIONA                          You just tell her she's not your true                           love. Everyone knows what happens when                           you find your...(Shrek drops her on                           the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to                           DuLoc the better.                                        DONKEY                          You're gonna love it there, Princess.                           It's beautiful!                                        FIONA                          And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?                           What's he like?                                        SHREK                          Let me put it this way, Princess. Men                           of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.                           (he and Donkey laugh)                  Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off                 the dust and grime.                                        DONKEY                          I don't know. There are those who think                           little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:                           Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're                           just jealous you can never measure up                           to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.                           But I'll let you do the ""measuring""                           when you see him tomorrow.                                        FIONA                          (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?                           It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop                           to make camp?                                        SHREK                          No, that'll take longer. We can keep                           going.                                        FIONA                          But there's robbers in the woods.                                       DONKEY                          Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting                           to sound good.                                        SHREK                          Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything                           we're going to see in this forest.                                                                  FIONA                          I need to find somewhere to camp now!                                            Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.                                  MOUNTAIN CLIFF                 Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves                 a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.                                        SHREK                          Hey! Over here.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, we can do better than that. I                           don't think this is fit for a princess.                                                                  FIONA                          No, no, it's perfect. It just needs                           a few homey touches.                                        SHREK                          Homey touches? Like what? (he hears                           a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona                           who has torn the bark off of a tree.)                                                                  FIONA                          A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee                           good night. (goes into the cave and                           puts the bark door up behind her)                                                                  DONKEY                          You want me to read you a bedtime story?                           I will.                                        FIONA                          (os) I said good night!                 Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the                 boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona                 still inside.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, What are you doing?                                       SHREK                          (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,                           come on. I was just kidding.                  LATER THAT NIGHT                 Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring                 up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations                 to Donkey.                                        SHREK                          And, uh, that one, that's Throwback,                           the only ogre to ever spit over three                           wheat fields.                                        DONKEY                          Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future                           from these stars?                                        SHREK                          The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.                           They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut,                           the Flatulent. You can guess what he's                           famous for.                                        DONKEY                          I know you're making this up.                                       SHREK                          No, look. There he is, and there's the                           group of hunters running away from his                           stench.                                        DONKEY                          That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little                           dots.                                        SHREK                          You know, Donkey, sometimes things are                           more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.                                                                  DONKEY                          (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what                           we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?                                                                  SHREK                          Our swamp?                                       DONKEY                          You know, when we're through rescuing                           the princess.                                        SHREK                          We? Donkey, there's no ""we"". There's                           no ""our"". There's just me and my swamp.                           The first thing I'm gonna do is build                           a ten-foot wall around my land.                                        DONKEY                          You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real                           deep just now. You know what I think?                           I think this whole wall thing is just                           a way to keep somebody out.                                        SHREK                          No, do ya think?                                       DONKEY                          Are you hidin' something?                                       SHREK                          Never mind, Donkey.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, this is another one of those onion                           things, isn't it?                                        SHREK                          No, this is one of those drop-it and                           leave-it alone things.                                        DONKEY                          Why don't you want to talk about it?                                                                  SHREK                          Why do you want to talk about it?                                       DONKEY                          Why are you blocking?                                       SHREK                          I'm not blocking.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, yes, you are.                                       SHREK                          Donkey, I'm warning you.                                       DONKEY                          Who you trying to keep out?                                       SHREK                          Everyone! Okay?                                       DONKEY                          (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.                           (grins)                  At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to                 the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.                                        SHREK                          Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and                           walks over to the edge of the cliff                           and sits down)                                        DONKEY                          What's your problem? What you got against                           the whole world anyway?                                        SHREK                          Look, I'm not the one with the problem,                           okay? It's the world that seems to have                           a problem with me. People take one look                           at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big,                           stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before                           they even know me. That's why I'm better                           off alone.                                        DONKEY                          You know what? When we met, I didn't                           think you was just a big, stupid, ugly                           ogre.                                        SHREK                          Yeah, I know.                                       DONKEY                          So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

DONKEY                          Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny                           one, right there. That one there?                                            Fiona puts the door back.                                       SHREK                          That's the moon.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, okay.                 DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom                 The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays                 in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic                 Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.                                        FARQUAAD                          Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror,                           show her to me. Show me the princess.                                                                  MIRROR                          Hmph.                 The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Ah. Perfect.                 Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up                 to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly                 at her image in the mirror.                  MORNING                 Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey                 who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes                 across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along                 with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles                 to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too                 big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but                 she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona                 is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still                 sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking                 in his sleep.                                        DONKEY                          (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like                           it like that. Come on, baby. I said                           I like it.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)                                       DONKEY                          Huh? What?                                       SHREK                          Wake up.                                       DONKEY                          What? (stretches and yawns)                                       FIONA                          Good morning. Hm, how do you like your                           eggs?                                        DONKEY                          Oh, good morning, Princess!                 Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.                                       SHREK                          What's all this about?                                       FIONA                          You know, we kind of got off to a bad                           start yesterday. I wanted to make it                           up to you. I mean, after all, you did                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Uh, thanks.                 Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.                                       FIONA                          Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead                           of us. (walks off)                  LATER                 They are once again on their way. They are walking through the                 forest. Shrek belches.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek!                                       SHREK                          What? It's a compliment. Better out                           than in, I always say. (laughs)                                        DONKEY                          Well, it's no way to behave in front                           of a princess.                  Fiona belches                                       FIONA                          Thanks.                                       DONKEY                          She's as nasty as you are.                                       SHREK                          (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly                           what I expected.                                        FIONA                          Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people                           before you get to know them.                  She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly                 from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into                 a tree.                                        ROBIN HOOD                          La liberte! Hey!                                       SHREK                          Princess!                                       FIONA                          (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior!                           And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses                           up her arm while Fiona pulls back in                           disgust)...beast.                                        SHREK                          Hey! That's my princess! Go find you                           own!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a                           little busy here?                                        FIONA                          (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't                           know who you think you are!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please                           let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.                           (laughs)                  Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out                 from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.                                        MERRY MEN                          Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          I steal from the rich and give to the                           needy.                                        MERRY MEN                          He takes a wee percentage,                                       ROBIN HOOD                          But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty                           damsels, man, I'm good.                                        MERRY MEN                          What a guy, Monsieur Hood.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          Break it down. I like an honest fight                           and a saucy little maid...                                        MERRY MEN                          What he's basically saying is he likes                           to get...                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush                           grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.                                                                  MERRY MEN                          That's bad.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          When a beauty's with a beast it makes                           me awfully mad.                                        MERRY MEN                          He's mad, he's really, really mad.                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          I'll take my blade and ram it through                           your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys                           'cause I'm about to start...                  There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and                 knocks Robin Hood unconscious.                                        FIONA                          Man, that was annoying!                 Shrek looks at her in admiration.                                       MERRY MAN                          Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at                           Fiona but she ducks out of the way)                                            The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to                 get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.                                  Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and                 then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is                 a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in                 mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down,                 and Fiona begins walking away.                                        FIONA                          Uh, shall we?                                       SHREK                          Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins                           walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa,                           whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come                           from?                                        FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          That! Back there. That was amazing!                           Where did you learn that?                                        FIONA                          Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,                           uh, one has to learn these things in                           case there's a...(gasps and points)                           there's an arrow in your butt!                                        SHREK                          What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you                           look at that? (he goes to pull it out                           but flinches because it's tender)                                                                  FIONA                          Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so                           sorry.                                        DONKEY                          (walking up) Why? What's wrong?                                       FIONA                          Shrek's hurt.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no,                           Shrek's gonna die.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, I'm okay.                                       DONKEY                          You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm                           too young for you to die. Keep you legs                           elevated. Turn your head and cough.                           Does anyone know the Heimlich?                                        FIONA                          Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help                           Shrek, run into the woods and find me                           a blue flower with red thorns.                                        DONKEY                          Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on                           it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die                           Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay                           away from the light!                                        SHREK & FIONA                          Donkey!                                       DONKEY                          Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.                           (runs off)                                        SHREK                          What are the flowers for?                                       FIONA                          (like it's obvious) For getting rid                           of Donkey.

Easy with the                           yankin'.                  As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and                 Shrek keeps dodging her hands.                                        FIONA                          I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue                 on their way.                  There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc.                 Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a                 small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as                 Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back                 into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting                 and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb                 that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it                 around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins                 eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers.                 Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting                 it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning                 it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group                 arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.                  WINDMILL                                       SHREK                          There it is, Princess.

DONKEY                          Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks                           Lord Farquaad's compensating for something,                           which I think means he has a really...(Shrek                           steps on his hoof) Ow!

Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks                 at Shrek with a new eye.                                        DONKEY                          Ohh!

SHREK                          Yeah. An ogre.                                       DONKEY                          Hey, where you goin'?                                       SHREK                          To get... move firewood. (sighs)                 Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already                 is.                  TIME LAPSE                 Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is                 nowhere to be seen.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess,                           where are you? Princess?                  Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.                                                        DONKEY                          It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing                           no games.                  Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't                 look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking                 out.                                        DONKEY                          Aah!

Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets                 down.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? What happened to you?

OUTSIDE                 Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his                 hand.                                        SHREK                          (to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's                           it going, first of all? Good? Um, good                           for me too. I'm okay.

He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey                 and Fiona talking.

That's why I can't                           stay here with Shrek.                  Shrek steps back in shock.

He throws the flower down and walks                 away.                  INSIDE                                       FIONA                          Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how                           it has to be. It's the only way to break                           the spell.

DONKEY                          What's the point of being able to talk                           if you gotta keep secrets?

Look at my eye twitchin'.                  Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks                 down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back                 inside the windmill.                  MORNING                 Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still                 awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.                                        FIONA                          I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,                           I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly                           runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!                           Shrek, there's something I want...(she                           looks and sees the rising sun, and as                           the sun crests the sky she turns back                           into a human.)                  Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards                 her.                                        FIONA                          Shrek.

FIONA                          But I thought that wouldn't matter to                           you.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at                           him in shock. He looks past her and                           spots a group approaching.) Ah, right                           on time. Princess, I've brought you                           a little something.                  Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal                 sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only                 like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers                 march by.                                        DONKEY                          What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots                           the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?                           Couldn't have been the donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona.

(Shrek takes the paper)                           Forgive me, Princess, for startling                           you, but you startled me, for I have                           never seen such a radiant beauty before.                           I'm Lord Farquaad.                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad                           snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,                           for I was just saying a short... (Watches                           as Farquaad is lifted off his horse                           and set down in front of her. He comes                           to her waist.) farewell.                                        FARQUAAD                          Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have                           to waste good manners on the ogre. It's                           not like it has feelings.                                        FIONA                          No, you're right. It doesn't.                 Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.

(a guard puts Fiona                           on the back of his horse)                                        FIONA                          Fare-thee-well, ogre.                 Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches                 them go.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, what are you doing?

You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if                           you two are such good friends, why don't                           you follow her home?

DULOC - CHURCH                 Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there.                 The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.

COURTYARD                 Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with                 a boom. The guards all take off running.

Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes                 'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.                                                        CONGREGATION                          Aawww!                 Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted                 up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around                 her.                                        WHISPERS                          ""Until you find true love's first kiss                           and then take love's true form. Take                           love's true form. Take love's true form.""                                            Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell                 and then is slowly lowered to the ground.                                        SHREK                          (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona.

But I don't understand. I'm supposed                           to be beautiful.                                        SHREK                          But you ARE beautiful.                 They smile at each other.                                       DONKEY                          (chuckles) I was hoping this would be                           a happy ending.                  Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...                 THE SWAMP                 ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm                 a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek                 and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting                 carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet                 which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end                 up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet                 instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now                 has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona                 walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over                 singing the song.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          God bless us, every one.                                       DONKEY                          (as he's done singing and we fade to                           black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't                           breathe. I can't breathe.                  THE END",,2020-03-10T22:52:08Z,2025-04-17T20:23:33Z,636,45,45,HTML,6,3

KYC PROCEDURE  NiceHash is appropriately implementing AML/CTF and security measures to diligently detect and prevent any malicious or unlawful use of NiceHash Services or use, which is strictly prohibited by these Terms, which are deemed as your agreement to provide required personal information for identity verification. Security measures include a KYC procedure, which is aimed at determining the identity of an individual user or an organisation.   We may ask you to complete this procedure before enabling some or all functionalities of the NiceHash platform and provide its services. A KYC procedure might be applied as a security measure when:  changing the email address linked to your NiceHash Account,    losing or changing your 2FA code;   logging in to your NiceHash Account for the first time after the launch of the new NiceHash Platform in August 2019,   gaining access to all or a portion of NiceHash Services, NiceHash Wallet and its related services or any portion thereof if they were disabled due to  and   activating your NiceHash Account if it has been deactivated due to its inactivity and/or security or other reasons.    HASHING POWER TRANSACTIONS  General   NiceHash may, at any time and in our sole discretion, (i) refuse any order submitted or provided hashing power, (ii) cancel an order or part of the order before it is executed, (iii) impose limits on the order amount permitted or on provided hashing power or (iv) impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of the NiceHash Platform and Mining Services without prior notice. For example, but not limited to, NiceHash may limit the number of open orders that you may establish or limit the type of supported Hashing power rigs and mining algorithms or NiceHash may restrict submitting orders or providing hashing power from certain locations.  Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about terminology, hashing power transactions’ definitions and descriptions, order types, order submission, order procedure, order rules and other restrictions and limitations of the hashing power transactions. NiceHash reserves the right to change any transaction, definitions, description, order types, procedure, rules, restrictions and limitations at any time for any reason.  Orders, provision of hashing power, payments, deposits, withdrawals and other transactions are accepted only through the interface of the NiceHash Platform, NiceHash API and NiceHash Account and are fixed by the software and hardware tools of the NiceHash Platform. If you do not understand the meaning of any transaction option, NiceHash strongly encourages you not to utilize any of those options.  Hashing Power Order  In order to submit an Hashing Power Order via the NiceHash Account, the Hashing power buyer must have available funds in his NiceHash Wallet.  Hashing power buyer submits a new order to buy hashing power via the NiceHash Platform or via the NiceHash API by setting the following parameters in the order form: NiceHash service server location, third-party mining pool, algorithm to use, order type, set amount he is willing to spend on this order, set price per hash he is willing to pay, optionally approximate limit maximum hashing power for his order and other parameters as requested and by confirming his order. Hashing power buyer may submit an order in maximum amount of funds available on his NiceHash Wallet at the time of order submission. Order run time is only approximate since order’s lifetime is based on the number of hashes that it delivers.  Particularly during periods of high volume, illiquidity, fast movement or volatility in the marketplace for any digital assets or hashing power, the actual price per hash at which some of the orders are executed may be different from the prevailing price indicated on NiceHash Platform at the time of your order. You understand that NiceHash is not liable for any such price fluctuations. In the event of market disruption, NiceHash Services disruption, NiceHash Hashing Power Marketplace disruption or manipulation or Force Majeure Event, NiceHash may do one or more of the following: (i) suspend access to the NiceHash Account or NiceHash Platform, or (ii) prevent you from completing any actions in the NiceHash Account, including closing any open orders. Following any such event, when trading resumes, you acknowledge that prevailing market prices may differ significantly from the prices available prior to such event.  When Hashing power buyer submits an order for purchasing of the Hashing power via NiceHash Platform or via the NiceHash API he authorizes NiceHash to execute the order on his behalf and for his account in accordance with such order. Hashing power buyer acknowledges and agrees that NiceHash is not acting as his broker, intermediary, agent or advisor or in any fiduciary capacity. NiceHash executes the order in set order amount minus NiceHash’s processing fee. Once the order is successfully submitted the order amount starts to decrease in real time according to the payments for the provided hashing power.  Hashing power buyer agrees to pay applicable processing fee to NiceHash for provided services. The NiceHash’s fees are deducted from Hashing power buyer’s NiceHash Wallet once the whole order is exhausted and completed. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the fees which are applicable at the time of provision of services. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. The changed fees will apply only for the NiceHash Services provided after the change of the fees. All orders submitted prior the fee change but not necessary completed prior the fee change will be charged according to the fees applicable at the time of the submission of the order.  NiceHash will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the Hashing power buyer’s purchase of the hashing power on the Hashing power marketplace under these Terms according to the best-effort delivery approach. In this respect NiceHash does not guarantee that the hashing power will actually be delivered or verified and does not guarantee any quality of the NiceHash Services.  Hashing power buyer may cancel a submitted order during order’s lifetime. If an order has been partially executed, Hashing power buyer may cancel the unexecuted remainder of the order. In this case the NiceHash’s processing fee will apply only for the partially executed order. NiceHash reserves the right to refuse any order cancellation request once the order has been submitted.  Selling Hashing Power and the Provision of Hashing Power  In order to submit the hashing power to the NiceHash stratum server the Hashing power provider must first point its Hashing power rig to the NiceHash stratum server. Hashing power provider is solely responsible for configuration of his Hashing power rig.  The Hashing power provider gets paid by Hashing power buyers for all validated and accepted work that his Hashing power rig has produced. The provided hashing power is validated by NiceHash’s stratum engine and validator. Once the hashing power is validated the Hashing power provider is entitled to receive the payment for his work. NiceHash logs all validated hashing power which was submitted by the Hashing power provider. The Hashing power provider receives the payments of current globally weighted average price on to his NiceHash Wallet or his selected personal Bitcoin address. The payments are made periodically depending on the height of payments. NiceHash reserves the right to hold the payments any time and for any reason by indicating the reason, especially if the payments represent smaller values. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the height of payments for provided hashing power, how the current globally weighted average price is calculated, payment periods, payment conditions and conditions for detention of payments. NiceHash reserves the right to change this payment policy according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason.  All Hashing power rig’s earnings and profitability calculations on NiceHash Platform are only for informational purposes. NiceHash does not warrant that your Hashing power rigs would achieve the same profitability or earnings as calculated on NiceHash Platform. You hereby acknowledge that it is possible that your Hashing power rigs would not be as profitable as indicated in our informational calculations or would not be profitable at all.  Hashing power provider agrees to pay applicable processing fee to NiceHash for provided Services. The NiceHash’s fees are deducted from all the payments made to the Hashing power provider for his provided work. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the fees which are applicable at the time of provision of services. Hashing power provider which has not submitted any hashing power to the NiceHash stratum server for a period of 90 days agrees that a processing fee of 0.00001000 BTC or less, depending on the unpaid mining balance, will be deducted from his unpaid mining balance. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. The changed fees will apply only for the NiceHash Services provided after the change of the fees.  NiceHash will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the provision of Hashing power providers’ hashing power on the Hashing power marketplace under these Terms according to the best-effort delivery approach. In this respect NiceHash does not guarantee that the hashing power will actually be delivered or verified and does not guarantee any quality of the NiceHash Services.   Hashing power provider may disconnect the Hashing power rig from the NiceHash stratum server any time. NiceHash reserves the right to refuse any Hashing power rig once the Hashing power rig has been pointed towards NiceHash stratum server.

power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/Mikael/VIPBot,Mikael/VIPBot,"If you already know everything about hosting a bot, you can skip this text file. If not, I'll quickly run through the process of creating a Discord Bot account with you so you can get started with your own custom Discord bot. Also I'll give you a brief overview of the possible ways to host a bot.   == 1) CREATING A DISCORD BOT ACCOUNT == You need a Discord bot account to be able to run the code I've written for you. - Make sure you're logged on the Discord *website* here: https://discord.com/ - Open up this page in your web browser: https://discord.com/developers/applications - Click the ""New Application"" button on the top right. - Give your application a name and then click ""Create"". - Create a Bot account by navigating to the ""Bot"" tab and clicking ""Add Bot"". - If you want your bot to be able to invited by others, tick the ""Public Bot"" checkbox. - Copy the Token using the ""Copy"" button. - Replace TOKEN in the config.json with the bot token you just copied. WARNING: Do not UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES share this Token with anyone as it's like a password for your bot. A Discord employee will never ask for it. Also, if your Bot is public and someone gets hold of the Token, they can wreak havoc on any server that the bot is on, including potentially deleting all messages. If your Token got leaked, make sure to click ""Regnerate"" as fast as possible to minimize the damage.   == 2) INVITING THE BOT TO YOUR SERVER == Now that your bot has been created, you can invite it to your server. - Now click the ""OAuth2"" tab on the application page you were on for creating your bot. - Tick the ""bot"" checkbox under ""Scopes"" - Tick the permissions your bot will need to function properly. You can find the necessary permissions in the text file called ""Needed permissions.txt"" - you can also give your bot the Administrator permission, but keep in mind that this means that the bot has every possible permission. - In the ""Scopes"" section you will find the link to invite your bot to any server that you have the ""Manage Server"" permission on.   == 3) HOSTING THE BOT == There are in general two ways to host your bot: Either you host the bot yourself on your computer (or any other local machine you have physical access to like a Raspberry Pi or even a smartphone) or you host it on a VPS (= Virtual Private Server), which is basically a small, cheap server that runs 24/7. Both have advantages and disadvantages: - When you host the bot on a local device, it's way easier to setup the bot and get running quickly, yet you have to keep that device powered on all the time, which might be undesirable. - A cheap VPS will cost you a few bucks monthly and you have to use SSH to connect to it and set it up, but it will be powered on 24/7 and will usually be a better overall solution for such a bot.   == 3a) HOSTING THE BOT ON A LOCAL DEVICE == To run the bot on a local device, you need to have Python installed and install the necessary modules for Python. You can download the newest version of Python here: https://www.python.org/. Make sure to let the installer include Python in $PATH. Now install the modules. You can do that on Windows by navigating into the folder where this text document is, pressing Shift + Right click anywhere in the folder, clicking ""Open in PowerShell"" and running this command: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt The steps should be very similar on Linux and macOS. If it says something along the lines of ""'python' not found"", try it with python3 instead or without ""python -m"" entirely and if it still doesn't work, your Python installation might be screwed up. Try reinstalling Python. To run your bot, just run ""python main.py"" (without quotation marks); ""python3"" instead of ""python"" might work too. If you get a message that looks like ""python: can't open file 'main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory"", you're probably not in the right folder with your command prompt.   == 3b) HOSTING THE BOT ON A VPS == The process of hosting your bot on a VPS is more complicated and will inevitably require you to do most of the research on your own, but I can boil it down to the following steps (considering that your VPS runs some Linux distribution like Debian or CentOS - if it runs Windows, install a Linux distribution). In general: - First of all, get the VPS up and running and establish a connection to it via SSH* (native on Linux and Mac, use PuTTY on Windows for that) on your machine. - Transfer the whole folder with the bot over to the VPS over e.g. SFTP (you could use FileZilla for that and don't use normal FTP, it's not secure). - Configure the VPS to your needs (like installing Python and other needed programs and libraries). - Get a supervisor running (you could use supervisord for that) and let it take care of running your bot. - Take security measures like closing unneeded ports, using keyfiles for SSH, not allowing root connections with SSH etc. - Think of a good backup strategy, in case something happens to the valuable data on your VPS. If you're using a VPS, it's very easy to screw something up (like not properly securing the SSH connection with keyfiles), so please do *A LOT* of research on how to run and maintain a VPS, otherwise you might end up having your database leaked or something similar. If you have further questions about hosting a Discord bot, just hit me up, I'll be glad to help. But I will not host your bot. * SSH = Secure Shell, a way to securely build up a remote connection to a server and use the command line in it, also includes SFTP for file transfer   == 4) VPS CHOICE == The discord.py community recommends the following VPS providers: - https://scaleway.com/ - Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by https://online.net/, based in Europe. - https://digitalocean.com/ - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide. - https://ovh.co.uk/ - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available. - https://time4vps.eu/ - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania. - https://linode.com/ - More cheap VPSes! - https://vultr.com/ - US-based, DigitalOcean-like. - https://galaxygate.net/ - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people. Using one of the cheaper options is usually a good start and will do just fine for small bots (up to a around hundred servers) and most providers will give you a way to smoothly upgrade your current plan. But it of course also depends on what your bot can do: Does it save a lot (= many gigabytes) data, is it usually in many voice channels, does it do image/video manipulation a lot? But there are lots of other providers, just do a Google search and you'll be sure to find the right one. Be wary of free hosting providers like Heraku, those services are not made to host Discord bots and you'll run into issues when trying to do so (believe me, I've fallen for them myself). If you have a spare Raspberry Pi, you can theoretically use it, but it will have subpar performance (especially if it's older or weaker than the Raspberry Pi 3B+).   That's about it, hopefully this helped you. If there's something wrong with your bot or something's not working, contact me. - Mikael.",python,2020-10-09T16:09:18Z,2025-03-12T07:02:56Z,72,22,22,Python,10,0

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. 1. Introduction Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party. What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. 1  2. Transactions We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.    Transaction Hash Transaction Hash Transaction Hash    Owner 1's Public Key Owner 2's Public Key Owner 3's Public Key         Owner 0's Signature Owner 1's Signature The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank. We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. 3. Timestamp Server The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it. Hash Hash Owner 2's Signature    Owner 1's Private Key Owner 2's Private Key Owner 3's Private Key      Block Item Item ... 2 Block Item Item ... Verify Verify Sign Sign  4. Proof-of-Work To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof- of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it. The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. 5. Network The steps to run the network are as follows: 1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes. 2) Each node collects new transactions into a block. 3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block. 4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. 5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent. 6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash. Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof- of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one. 3   Block Nonce Tx Tx ... Block Nonce Tx Tx ...   Prev Hash Prev Hash    New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one. 6. Incentive By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended. The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free. The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth. 7. Reclaiming Disk Space Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.  Block Hash0 Hash1 Hash2 Hash3 Tx0 Tx1 Tx2 Tx3  Block Header (Block Hash)   Prev Hash Nonce  Root Hash   Hash01 Hash23  Block  Block Header (Block Hash)   Prev Hash Nonce  Root Hash   Hash01 Hash23 Hash2 Hash3 Tx3 Transactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree After Pruning Tx0-2 from the Block A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory. 4  8. Simplified Payment Verification It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it. Longest Proof-of-Work Chain    Block Header Block Header Block Header       Prev Hash Nonce Prev Hash Nonce Prev Hash Nonce      Merkle Root Merkle Root Merkle Root   Hash01 Hash23 Merkle Branch for Tx3 Hash2 Hash3 Tx3 As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification. 9. Combining and Splitting Value Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender. It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history. 5  Transaction In Out In ... ...       10. Privacy The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were. Traditional Privacy Model Identities Transactions New Privacy Model Identities Transactions As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner. 11. Calculations We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent. The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1. The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]: p = probability an honest node finds the next block q = probability the attacker finds the next block qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind       Trusted Third Party    q ={ 1 if p≤q} z q/pz if pq 6 Counterparty Public  Public  Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind. We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late. The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at that moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction. The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked after it. He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:  = z qp To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point: ∞ ke−{q/pz−k ifk≤z} ∑k=0 k!⋅ 1 ifkz Rearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution... z ke− z−k 1−∑k=0 k! 1−q/p  Converting to C code...    #include <math.h>    double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)    {        double p = 1.0 - q;        double lambda = z * (q / p);        double sum = 1.0;        int i, k;        for (k = 0; k <= z; k++)        {            double poisson = exp(-lambda);            for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)                poisson *= lambda / i;            sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k)); } return sum; } 7  Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.    q=0.1    z=0    P=1.0000000    z=1    P=0.2045873    z=2    P=0.0509779    z=3    P=0.0131722    z=4    P=0.0034552    z=5    P=0.0009137    z=6    P=0.0002428    z=7    P=0.0000647    z=8    P=0.0000173    z=9    P=0.0000046    z=10   P=0.0000012    q=0.3    z=0    P=1.0000000    z=5    P=0.1773523    z=10   P=0.0416605    z=15   P=0.0101008    z=20   P=0.0024804    z=25   P=0.0006132    z=30   P=0.0001522    z=35   P=0.0000379    z=40   P=0.0000095    z=45   P=0.0000024    z=50   P=0.0000006 Solving for P less than 0.1%...

Conclusion We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism. 8  References [1] W. Dai, ""b-money,"" http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt, 1998. [2] H. Massias, X.S. Avila, and J.-J.

We will be evaluating the project using a script. So please make sure you follow the instructions, or your assignment might not get graded.  Degree Distribution The degree distribution is a measure of the frequency of nodes that have a certain degree. Implement a function degreedist, which takes a GraphFrame object as input and computes the degree distribution of the graph. The function should return a DataFrame with two columns: degree and count. For the graphs provided to you, test and report which graphs are scalefree, namely whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. That is, the fraction P(k) of     nodes in the network having k connections to other nodes goes for large values of k as P(k) ~ k−γ where γ is a parameter whose value is typically in the range 2 < γ < 3, although occasionally it  may lie outside these bounds. Answer the following questions:   1. Generate a few random graphs. You can do this using networkx’s random graph generators. Do the random graphs you tested appear to be scale free? (Include degree distribution with your answer). 2. Do the Stanford graphs provided to you appear to be scale free?    Note that GraphFrames represents all graphs as directed, so every edge in the undirected graphs provided or generated must be added twice, once for each direction. When finding if the degrees follow a power law you can then use either the indegree or outdegree, as they should be equal.   Centrality Centrality measures are a way to determine nodes that are important based on the structure of the graph. Closeness centrality measures the distance of a node to all other nodes. We will define the closeness centrality as CC(v) =1/ ∑ d(u,v) u∈V    where d(u, v) is the shortestpath distance between u and v. Implement the function closeness, which takes a GraphFrame object as input and computes the closeness centrality of every node in the graph. The function should return a DataFrame with two columns: id and closeness. Consider a small network of 10 computers, illustrated below, with nodes representing computers and edges representing direct connections of two machines. If two computers are not connected directly, then the information must flow through other connected machines. Answer the following questions about the graph:  1. Rank the nodes from highest to lowest closeness centrality. 2. Suppose we had some centralized data that would sit on one machine but would be shared with all computers on the network. Which two machines would be the best  candidates to hold this data based on other machines having few hops to access this data?     Articulation Points Articulation points, or cut vertices, are vertices in the graph that, when removed, create more components than there were originally. For example, in the simple chain 1-2-3, there is a single component. However, if vertex 2 were removed, there would be 2 components. Thus, vertex 2 is an articulation point. Implement the function articulations, which takes a GraphFrame object as input and finds all the articulation points of a graph. The function should return a DataFrame with two columns, id and articulation, where articulation is a 1 if the node is an articulation point, otherwise a 0.   Suppose we had the terrorist communication network given in the file 9_11_edgelist.txt . If our goal was to disrupt the flow of communication between different groups, isolating the articulation points would be a good way to do this. Answer the following questions: 1. In this example, which members should have been targeted to best disrupt communication in the organization?",,2020-03-16T04:23:33Z,2025-01-02T18:29:15Z,8247,7,7,Python,3,0

There are two types of biometrics: behavioral and physical. Behavioral biometrics is generally used for verification while physical biometrics can be used for either identification or verification. Identification is determining who a person is. It involves trying to find a match for a person’s biometric data in a database containing records of people and that characteristic. This method requires time and a large amount of processing power, especially if the database is very large. Verification is determining if a person is who they say they are. It involves comparing a user’s biometric data to the previously recorded data for that person to ensure that this is the same person. This method requires less processing power and time, and is used for access control (to buildings or data). In order for the biometrics to be ultra-secure and to provide more-than-average accuracy, more than one form of biometric identification is required. Hence the need arises for the use of multimodal biometrics. This uses a combination of different biometric recognition technologies. In certain situations, the user might find one form of biometric identification is not exact enough for identification. This can be the case with fingerprints, where at least 10% of the population have worn, cut or unrecognizable prints. Multimodal biometric technology uses more than one biometric identifier to compare the identity of the person. Here, we have increased the accuracy of biometrics using two modalities one is fingerprint and the other is iris. Fusion of these two modalities is experimented for authentication purpose. The features of fingerprint and iris have been extracted which are fused and saved as a database. If one of the technologies is unable to identify, the system can still use the other to accurately identify against.",,2019-02-28T17:58:18Z,2025-02-22T14:32:16Z,6328,6,6,C++,0,0

power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/Noykarde/NoykardeRepository,Noykarde/NoykardeRepository,"                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}     Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:      {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.",,2017-05-22T21:45:09Z,2025-04-19T22:48:16Z,27,5,5,,7,0
power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/minecraft77/blk-stealthspider,minecraft77/blk-stealthspider,"                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 19 November 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.    A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.    The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.    An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published     by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a ""Source"" link that leads users to an archive of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.",,2017-12-28T18:26:26Z,2025-04-04T03:31:35Z,18,5,5,,5,0

Products that allow you to borrow, save, invest, trade, and more. Based on open source technology anyone can plan with.  DeFi is an open and global financial system that has been built for years - another way of being a sharp, tightly managed, and cohesive system of decades-old infrastructure and processes. It gives you more control and visibility than your money. It gives you exposure to global markets and other options for your local currency or banking options. DeFi products open financial services to anyone with an internet connection and are highly managed and maintained by their users. To date, tens of billions of dollars worth of crypto have gone through DeFi applications and is growing every day.  What is DeFi? DeFi is an integrated name for financial products and services accessible to anyone who can use Ethereum - anyone with an Internet connection. With DeFi, markets remain open and no central authorities can block payments or deny you access to anything. Services that used to be slow and vulnerable to human error are now automated and secure as they are governed by a code that anyone can check and evaluate.  There is a thriving crypto-economy out there, where you can borrow, borrow, length / short, earn interest, and more. Crypto-savvy Argentinians have used DeFi to escape inflation. Companies have begun distributing their pay to their employees in real-time. Some people even withdraw and repay loans worth millions of dollars without the need for personal information.   DeFi vs Traditional Finance One of the best ways to see the power of DeFi is to understand the problems that exist today.  Some people are not given access to setting up a bank account or using financial services. Lack of access to financial services can prevent people from being employed. Financial services can prevent you from paying. Hidden payment for financial services is your data. Governments and private institutions can close markets at will. Trading hours are usually limited to one-hour business hours. Transfers may take days due to personal processes. There is a premium for financial services because mediation institutions require their cutting.     DeFi Use Cases DeFi has revolutionized the financial world over the past few years. This new approach to financial planning can transcend asset systems through efficiency and security. It is true that there are certain dangers in DeFi but those are within the concrete limits.  Let's take a look at the most effective DeFi usage cases -  Asset Management One of DeFi's biggest effects is that users can now enjoy more control over their assets. Many DeFi projects provide solutions that allow users to manage their assets, including - buying, selling, and transferring digital assets. Therefore, users can also earn interest on their digital assets.  Contrary to the traditional financial system, DeFi allows users to maintain the privacy of their sensitive information. Think of the secret keys or passwords of your financial accounts - you should have shared that information with the appropriate organizations beforehand.  Now, different DeFi projects, such as Metamask, Argent, or Gnosis Safe help users encrypt and store those pieces of information on their devices. This ensures that only users have access to their accounts and can manage their assets. Therefore, asset management is one of the most widely used financial services cases for users.  Compliance with AML and CFT Rates through the KYT Mechanism Traditional financial systems focus heavily on Know-Your-Customer (KYC) agreements. KYC Guidelines are its major law enforcement tool for using Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering-the-Financing-of-Terrorism (CFT) standards.  However, KYC guidelines often conflict with DeFi's privacy efforts. DeFi responds to this problem with a new concept called the Know-Your-Transaction (KYT) mechanism. This approach suggests that low-level infrastructure will focus on ethical behavior for digital addresses rather than user considerations.  Therefore, KYT solves two issues simultaneously - monitoring real-time operations and ensuring user privacy. This makes KYT one of the biggest gaps in low-cost cases.  Non-Governmental Organizations or DAOs The DAOs are partners of the central financial institutions of DeFi - making it one of the pillars of low-income finance cases.  In the traditional system, central financial institutions play a major role. These organizations operate as administrative institutions that regulate basic financial operations, such as monetization, asset management, administrative utilization, etc.  The Ethereum blockchain echerestem has introduced empowered organizations to achieve the same goals. However, DAOs are naturally empowered and do not conform to the limits set by central governments or authorities.  Analysis and Risk Tools Transparency and redistribution of world power have opened the way for the discovery and analysis of unprecedented user data. With access to this information, users can make informed business decisions, discover new financial opportunities, and implement better risk management strategies.  A new type of data analytics with useful blockchain tools and dashboards has emerged in this industry trend. DeFi projects such as DeFi Pulse or CoDeFi Data bring an impressive amount of analytics and risk management tool.  Now, businesses are moving faster as they enjoy unpredictable competitive advantages. This is certainly one of the most widely used financial cases.  Receivables and Manufacturing Goods Smart contracts allow for the receipt of token receipts and have become one of the most distinctive scenarios for DeFi use. Making a token further means setting a contract value based on the underlying financial asset or set of assets. This underlying financial asset acts as a security measure, which means it can include - bonds, fiat currencies, commodities, market indicators, interest rates, or stock prices.  Now, the issuance of outgoing tokens is a secondary security and their value varies with the number of key securities (bonds or fiat money). Thus, the output actually creates artificial goods.  Synthetix and dYdX are some of the leading DeFi projects focused on token acquisitions.  Network Infrastructure Effect In a DeFi ecosystem, objects within the system can connect and interact. This design feature is known as integration and serves as a protocol for infrastructure development. As a result, DeFi projects are continuously integrated with the network result.  Infrastructure tools for use of DeFi applications are remarkable. Various DeFi projects, such as TruffleSuite or InfuraAPI, are good examples in this case.  Enhanced Digital ID Blockchain-based identity system systems are already gaining a lot of attention in recent times. Pairing DeFi programs with these patent systems can help people access the global economic system.  The traditional method rewards personal income or assets collected as credit providers. With digital identity paired with DeFi, you may be looking for other practical attributes, such as - financial services or professional ability.  This new type of digital ID can help the poor to access DeFi apps from any internet connection. It can certainly be one of the cases of possible use.  Insurance Insurance is one of the largest financial institutions and has already been proven to be one of the biggest charges for using DeFi. The current insurance system is crowded with paperwork, old audit plans, and bureaucratic insurance claim processes.  With the successful implementation of smart contracts, all these problems with the current system can be solved.  Many DeFi projects (Nexus Mutual, Opyn, and VouchForMe) provide blockchain access to insurance against DeFi or contract risk.  P2P borrowing and borrowing As DeFi bids farewell to traditional banking systems, a space for the lending and lending market has emerged. Therefore, borrowing and lending is one of the most important aspects of using DeFi.  However, the DeFi ecosystem is well suited for peer-to-peer (P2P) borrowing and lending efforts. Many DeFi projects have already entered the market focusing on this particular application case. Among these programs, Compound and PoolTogether are two well-known names. These projects have independent policies for lending and lending.  Payment Solutions One of DeFi's top drivers was serving non-bankers or understated banks from the get-go. DeFi's natural features make it ideal for solving the problems of current global payment systems. DeFi provides fast, secure, and transparent solutions compared to asset systems.  As DeFi lowers the demand for intermediaries, making payments easier and more transparent, DeFi-based blockchain-based payment solutions can appeal to non-bankers.",,2021-08-17T08:36:08Z,2025-04-16T04:51:40Z,0,5,5,,0,0

PMUs have gained more popularity because of their ability to accurately measure bus voltage and branch current phasors with respect to a Global Positioning System (GPS) clock every few microseconds. Placing PMUs at all locations in a power system network is not economically feasible due to their cost. Therefore, it is necessary to properly distribute PMUs in order to obtain a good estimation of power system states. This problem is known as an optimal PMU placement (OPP) problem.

power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/elemo12/Reading-class-4,elemo12/Reading-class-4,"Common issues may be resolved by identifying symptoms and putting measures in place to address them. Typical issues include a lack of power, physical damage, an unsuccessful boot, an application that won't start, and faulty peripherals. Let's take a closer look at a few of them.  A typical start is impossible When your computer won't boot up, think like a detective and look for clues. What has changed since the last time I checked? Is there any new hardware or software that you've installed? Any wires that may have fallen loose have been moved? Did the operating system restart on its own after the update was applied? After a recent OS upgrade, the machine may not start up properly at first (that is, slowly or with errors). You may be able to repair it by restarting your computer. You may also use the System Restore tool in Windows to go back to a restore point from the previous day if that doesn't work. A recovery or troubleshooting mode may be offered if the operating system fails to start at all. If that's an option, take it. If that doesn't work, try booting from the operating system's removable installation disc and selecting Repair to enter the Windows Recovery Environment (RE). Windows 10's Settings app (Update & Security > Recovery > Advanced Startup > Restart Now) may also get you there.  Unable to download or launch a certain software Hardware incompatibilities, particularly with the display adapter, are typically to blame for problems with a certain programme. The most recent games sometimes need the use of high-performance display adapters and the most recent drivers. The application's installation software should be able to tell you if there are any issues with your computer's hardware. If it doesn't and you start experiencing issues after launching the programme, check online for any known hardware compatibility issues. Try obtaining the most recent driver version from the adapter manufacturer's website to update your video card (display adapter) driver. The next step is to determine whether a patch or update is available for download from the application's manufacturer's website. A bug in your own system, such as a small incompatibility between a programme and its operating system or some hardware, is likely the cause of any problems you're encountering. Installing the programme again may cure your issue, since this is more common than you may expect. Is there no joy in sight? Check to verify whether the programme needs a certain version of Windows. A newer version of the software may be available even though it was created for an earlier version of Windows. If it doesn't work, you may try running it in Compatibility Mode, which emulates a previous version of Windows. It's easy to use: Right-click the shortcut for the programme (or its executable file) and choose Troubleshoot compatibility from the menu. To let Windows make an educated guess as to the proper settings, click the Try suggested settings button. To test for compatibility with an earlier version of Windows, use the Compatibility tab in the program's Properties box.  Apps are up and running, although they sometimes freeze.  Many processes might be running at the same time on today's operating systems, especially those on mobile devices. Processes are scheduled to use processor time so that it seems as though many applications are operating at the same time. The problem is that some of these software programmes might malfunction, causing them to become unusable. It is possible to compel them to leave in this situation: Windows: Using ctrl+alt+del, you can go to the Task Manager, where you can right-click on the errant programme and choose End task to end its life. MacOS: Force Quit may be found in the Apple menu system. Linux: To see the PIDs that the Linux kernel has allocated to currently executing processes, use the ps command. To put an end to the process, use the following command with the PID: Killing a process using the SIGKILL signal, -9, may put an end to bad behaviour. An Android-powered phone: To force stop an app, open the Settings app, pick Apps, select the app from the list, and touch Force Stop.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}     Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:      {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.",,2016-08-27T20:43:21Z,2024-09-16T17:24:50Z,13,4,4,,15,2
power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/BoysGmNg/EksvancRawGithubLicense,BoysGmNg/EksvancRawGithubLicense,"                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

It holds the promise of increasing safety, comfort, personal productivity or entertainment, traﬃc eﬃciency, cost and environmental beneﬁts. One area of investigation is the ability of cars to drive closer together, or even to platoon. Since physical sensors such as radars and cameras do not provide the required system performance, reliable communication between vehicles is a means to achieve this. While the wireless communication standard ITS-G5 is being selected as the technology of choice, ultra - wideband (UWB) as a second independent communication technology may provide additional beneﬁts. UWB physical layer enables accurate ranging at low latency, improved robustness against interference, ultra low power consumption, low power spectral density, low cost, low impact on existing narrowband systems and lower probability of intercept and detection. In this thesis, we investigate the feasibility of using UWB next to WiFi-p, examine the robustness of UWB communication in platooning mode with respect to diﬀerences in velocities, typical inter-vehicle environment, outdoor environment and ascertain the ranging accuracy that can be achieved through UWB. We implemented a test platform, TP-UWB (Test Platform for evaluation and analysis of UWB) using LPCXpresso 4337 and DecaWave DW1000 UWB transceiver. The test platform enables us to measure the UWB link quality and range, perform test automation by varying test parameters that inﬂuence UWB behavior such as packets or message, channels, Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), preamble lengths, preamble codes, standard or non-standard Start of the Frame Delimiter (SFD) and Smart Power enablement. We conduct experiments in table-top, outdoor and inter-vehicle environments using the test platform. We then perform a behavioral analysis of UWB using diﬀerent parameters indicated above and determine the best conﬁguration of UWB for platooning such that it operates with least possible interference to WiFi-p.

power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/FenryHenry/LabNine,FenryHenry/LabNine,"Its labNine, not much to say. However, i think the to truly understand this lab one must refer to the US declaration of independence. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",,2018-11-03T05:02:29Z,2025-04-04T03:31:39Z,410,3,3,Java,1,0
power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/BholaHrishikesh/psychic-rotary-phone,BholaHrishikesh/psychic-rotary-phone,"If you like this build I’ve also written other posts on building a simple voice controlled Magic Mirror with the Raspberry Pi and the AIY Projects Voice Kit, and a face-tracking cyborg dinosaur called “Do-you-think-he-saurs” with the Raspberry Pi and the AIY Projects Vision Kit.  At the tail end of last month, just ahead of the announcement of the pre-order availability of the new Google AIY Project Voice Kit, I finally decided to take the kit I’d managed to pick up with issue 57 of the MagPi out of its box, and put it together.  However inspired by the 1986 Google Pi Intercom build put together Martin Mander, ever since I’ve been thinking about venturing beyond the cardboard box and building my own retro-computing enclosure around the Voice Kit. I was initially thinking about using an old radio until I came across the GPO 746 Rotary Telephone. This is a modern day replica of what must be the most iconic rotary dial phone in the United Kingdom. This is the phone that sat on everybody’s desk, and in their front halls, throughout the 1970’s. It was the standard rental phone, right up until British Telecom was privatised in the middle of the 1980's.   The GPO 746 Rotary Telephone. While the GPO 746 is available in the United States it’s half the price, and there are a lot more colours to choose from, if you’re buying the phone in the United Kingdom. A definite business opportunity for someone there because it turns out that, on the inside, it’s a rather interesting bit of hardware.  Gathering your Tools For this project you’ll need is a small Philips “00” watch maker’s screwdriver, a craft knife, scissors, a set of small wire snips, a drill and a 2 to 4mm bit, a soldering iron, solder, some jumper wires, female header blocks, a couple of LEDs, some electrical tape, a cable tie, and possibly some Sugru and heat shrink tubing, depending how neat you want to be about things.  While I did end up soldering a few things during the build, it is was mostly restricted to joining wires together and should definitely be approachable for beginners.  Opening the Box Ahead of the new Voice Kit hitting the shelves next month I managed to get my hands on a few pre-production kits, which fortunately meant that I didn’t have to take my cardboard box apart to put together a new build.   The new AIY Project Voice Kit. The new AIY Voice Kit comes comes in a box very similar to the original kit distributed with the Mag Pi magazine. The box might be a bit thinner, but otherwise things look much the same.  Missing from my pre-production kits the two little plastic spacers that keep the Voice HAT from bending down and hitting the top of the Raspberry Pi. I’m presuming they’ll include them in the production kits, without them the underside of the HAT tends to push downwards and the solder tails of the speaker screw terminal shorts out against the Raspberry Pi’s HDMI connector. I fixed this by adding some electrical tape to separate the two boards, but the spacers would have worked a lot better and added more stability.  The only component swap was the arcade button, gone was the separate lamp, holder, microswitch and button—all four components have been replaced by a single button with everything integrated. Since it was somewhat fiddly to get that assembled last time, this is a definite improvement.  While my pre-production kits didn’t include it, I’m told the retail version will have a copy of the MagPi Essentials AIY Projects book written by Lucy Hattersley on how to “Create a Voice Kit with your Raspberry Pi.”  Other than that, things went together much as before. At which point I quickly put together the Voice Kit, this time however, I didn’t bother with the cardboard box.  Opening the Phone Pulling the replica GPO 746 out of its box you’ll find it comes in two parts, the main phone with the dial, and a separate handset which plugs in underneath the base.  The first thing I needed to do was take the base unit of the phone apart and figure out how it worked. Until I knew what I had to work with, it was going to be impossible to figure out a sensible plan to integrate the Voice Kit.   Opening up the GPO 746. The main PCB is mounted on the base along with a steel weight to give the impression of “heft” to the replica phone. There’s also a large bell, which makes that distinctive ringing noise familiar to anyone that owned or used a GPO 746 back in the 1970's.   The circuitry attached to the base of the GPO 746. To the left of the PCB is the jack socket where the telephone line is connected (two wires, red and green). To the top, two switches. One is for handset, and the other for ringer, volume. At the bottom another jack switch (four wires, red, black, yellow, and green) where the handset is attached.  The only thing of real interest on the PCB is the Hualon Microelectronics HM9102D which is a switchable tone/pulse dialer chip, which we’re actually not going to use.  In fact, since the line voltage in the UK is +50V, pretty much none of it was going to be any use to me. So after measuring the voltage on the cable connecting the dialer to the PCB, I snipped the wires to the switches and the jacks—leaving them in place with as much trailing wire as possible in case they were going to come in useful,—and then removed both the PCB and the bell. After that, I filed down the plastic moulding that held everything in place leaving me with a large flat area which was perfectly sized for the Raspberry Pi and the Voice HAT.  The moulded top of the phone has two assemblies, a simple microswitch toggled using a hinged and sprung plastic plate when the phone handset is taken on and off the hook, and the dialer assembly which is connected to the base and the PCB using a ribbon cable.  How the Dialer Works It was time to break out the logic analyser. While I’ve got a Saleae Logic Pro 16 on my desk, if you’re thinking about picking one up for the first time I’d really recommend the much cheaper Logic 8, or even the lower specification Logic 4, rather than splashing out on the higher end model. Either will take you a long way before you get the itch that you have to upgrade.   Logic Analyser attached to the dial of the GPO 746 powered up using a Bench Power Supply. Stripping the connector from the cable that connected the dialer to the PCB and powering it up with a bench power supply to +5V—which is more-or-less what I’d measured on the cable and was something I could reasonably expect to get from the Raspberry Pi—I connected the rest of the cables to my logic analyser and started turning the dial confidently expecting to see something interesting going on. I found nothing, I had flat lines, there was no signal going down the wires at all.  After playing around with the voltage for a few minutes, with no results, I stripped the dialer assembly out of the case for a closer look.   Dialer assembly removed from the GPO 746. The back of the dialer assembly has two LEDs, which I thought was rather odd since there dial isn’t illuminated in any way, at least not from the outside. Interestingly these two LEDs flash briefly when the dial is turned all the way around to hit the stop.  Cracking the case brings us to something else interesting, it’s a light box. Designed to keep the light from the LEDs inside, it has a hole which rotates around as you dial a number.   Taking apart the dial assembly. The hole exposes one of twelve photoresistors to the light from the LEDs and the number (or symbol) you’re dialing determines which of the resistors will be under the hole when the dial stop is reached.   The photoresistors inside the dial assembly. It was all passive circuitry. No wonder I hadn’t seen anything on the logic analyser, there wasn’t any logic to analyse. It was all analogue.  Unfortunately for me, the Raspberry Pi has no built in analogue inputs. That means I’d have to pull a Microchip MCP3008, or something similar, from the shelf and build some circuitry. I’d also have to figure out how the resistance for twelve photoresistors ended up travelling down just eight wires, which sort of had me puzzled at this point.  That all sounded like a lot of effort. Since I really only wanted to dial a single digit to activate the Voice Kit, and I didn’t care what that was, I decided to ignore the photoresistors and concentrate on the dial stop.   The dialer mechanism showing the back of the dial stop (left) with microswitch. Unlike the original GPO 746, the dial stop on this replica moves. It drops when you hit it with the side of your finger when dialling a number. It turned out that it was connected to a microswitch, and when the microswitch was activated, this was the thing that briefly flashed the LEDs and exposed the appropriate photoresistor. It was actually all rather clever. A really neat way to minimise the build of materials costs for the phone. Startups thinking about building hardware could learn a lesson or two in economy from this phone.   Using the logic analyser on the microswitch. Just to be sure I had this right, I dialled down the bench power supply to a Raspberry Pi friendly +3.3V and wired up the microswitch to the logic analyser.   Applying +3.3V (middle trace) and “dialing” shows the microswitch toggling (lower trace). Dialling a number on the dialer assembly worked as expected. We could ignore the dial itself, and those photoresistors that would be a pain to use with the Raspberry Pi and just make use of the microswitch. In fact we could more-or-less just replace the arcade button with this switch.  Integrating the AIY Project Kit Moving on, I really wanted to reuse both the speaker and the microphone already in the handset instead of the ones the came with the Voice Kit.   Handset stripped of its speaker and micrphone, Taking apart the handset—the end caps holding the speaker and microphone just screw off—showed that there were four wires inside the curled cable. Two for the speaker, and two for the electret condenser microphone.  The Voice Kit makes use of two InvenSense ICS-43434 MEMS microphones which use I2S to communicate. They’re a solid replacement for traditional 2-wire analog microphones like the one we in the handset of the GPO 746.   The Voice HAT Microphone daughter board. Looking at the Voice HAT microphone daughter board, it has been designed so that you can break the two microphones away from the board at the perforations and then you can solder the wiring harness directly to the pads. So long as you keep the signals consistent you should be able to place the mics pretty much anywhere, and with a clock rate of ~3MHz, a longer cable should be fine.  Unfortunately I2S uses more wires than I had available. Unless I wanted to replace the curled cable, and I didn’t really want to have to do that, I was in trouble.  Putting that aside for a moment I decided to start with the dialer assembly. Refitting it to the case, I snipped the wires leading to the microswitch and, grabbing the wiring harness for the arcade button, I soldered the microswitch to the relevant wires in the harness.   Soldering the Voice HAT button wiring harness to the phone’s microswitch. I then grabbed a ultra-bright LED and a 220Ω resistor from the shelves and soldered the resistor in-line with the LED. I then attached my new LED assembly to the other two wires in the arcade button wiring harness. At this point I had a replacement for the arcade button that came with the Voice Kit.   Attaching a current limiting resistor to my LED. Giving up on putting microphones into the handset I pulled out a drill and measuring the spacing between the two microphones I drilled a couple of holes in the external shell of the phone.   Drilling two holes in the shell of the phone. These weren’t going to be visible from the outside as there is a void between the top of the phone, where the handset rests. This is a carrying handle where you can tuck your hand in, and pick up the phone. In the old days this let you pick up the phone and wander around the room—well, so long as the cable tying you to the wall was long enough.   Attaching the Voice HAT microphone board to the phone shell. I then went ahead and tucked the microphone board behind the spring which operated the hook mechanism. There was just enough room to secure it there with a cable tie, and some Sugru.  After that I plugged the handset into the jack on the base and connected the two wires from the handset jack that were attached to the speaker to the screw terminals on the Voice HAT.   The re-wired internals of the modified GPO 746. Microphone board and Voice Kit both fixed in place with Sugru. Stripping the jack out where the phone line originally ran left two upright pillars that used to go on either side of the jack. I threaded the end of a 2.5A micro-USB charger through the hole and tied it around the pillars for strain relief.  Which completed the re-wiring. The arcade button had been replaced with the dial stop microswitch and an LED which I was going to tuck just ahead of the microphone board in a convenient clip-like part of the body moulding. The speaker had been swapped out directly with the one in the handset—fortunately the impedance match wasn’t too far off—and the microphone had been mounted somewhere convenient inside the main body of the phone.  A Working Phone Screwing everything back together we have once again something that looks like a phone.   The assembled phone. I booted the Raspberry Pi, logged in via SSH and went ahead and ran the src/assistant_library_with_button_demo.py script from the dev console.   A working build, but it’s not quite there yet. Success. Picking up the handset and dialling a number, any number, let you talk to the Voice Assistant. But it wasn’t quite there yet. While it worked, it didn’t feel like a phone.  Adding a Dial Tone What the phone needed was a dial tone. It needed to play when the handset was lifted and shut off when the phone was dialled, or the handset replaced.  The phone hook works the opposite way that you might expect, when the handset is in the cradle the microswitch that simulates the hook is open as the bar below it is pushed down by the hook. When the handset is off the hook, then the microswitch is closed as the bar moves upwards.  Conveniently the Voice HAT breaks out most of the unused GPIO pins from the Raspberry Pi, so at least in theory wiring the the microswitch attached to the the hook mechanism to one to the Voice HAT should be fairly simple.   Available unpopulated connectors on the Voice HAT. (Image credit: Google) Thinking about how to approach this in software however left us with a bit of a quandary. While the underlying Python GPIO library allows us to detect both the rising and falling edge events when a switch is toggled, the AIY wrapper code doesn’t in the Voice Kit doesn’t. While I could have gone in and modified the wrapper code to add that functionality, I decided I didn’t want to mess around with that—perhaps I’ll get around to it later and send them a pull request—instead I decided to fix it in hardware and wire the hook switch into both GPIO4 and GPIO17. That way I could use one pin to monitor for GPIO.RISING, and the other for GPIO.FALLING.   Wiring up the phone hook. It’s easy enough to do that using the aiy._drivers._button.Button class, and two callback methods. One called with the handset is taken off the hook, and the other called with it is replaced.   All the additional wiring in place and working. We can then use the pygame library to play a WAV file in the background when the handset is lifted, and stop when it is replaced. We also have to add a stop command inside the _on_button_pressed() method so that the dial tone stops when the phone is dialled, and a call to stop_conversation() to stop the Voice Assistant talking if the handset is returned on hook while Google is answering our question.  Adding a Greeting and a Hang Up Noise We’re not quite there yet, we can also use aiy.audio.play_wave() to add that distinctive disconnect noise when Google finishes talking and “hangs up” before returning to our dial tone. We can also use aiy.audio.say(‘…’) call to add a greeting when Google “picks up” the phone to talk to us.   The final build. It’s surprising how much atmosphere just adding these simple sounds ended up making to the build, and how much the user experience was improved. It now doesn’t just look like a rotary phone, it sort of feels, and perhaps more importantly, sounds like one too.  The Script The final version of the script has amazingly small number of modifications away from the original version distributed byGoogle. Which sort of shows how simple it is to build something that looks and feels very different from the original cardboard box with not a lot of effort, at least on the software   If you want to replicate the build you can grab the two mono WAV files I used for the build from Dropbox. Although, if you’re outside the the United Kingdom, you might want to replace the standard British dial tone of 350Hz and 450Hz—which you hear any time you lift a phone off the hook—with something more appropriate.  Available to Preorder The new kits are being produced by Google, and are available to pre-order at Micro Center and through their resellers like Adafruit, and SeeedStudio. The AIY Voice Kit is priced at $25 on its own, but you can pick one up for free if you order a Raspberry Pi 3 at $35 for in-store pickup from Micro Center.   My new retro rotary phone build next to my original Voice Kit. The kit will be available in the United Kingdom through Pimoroni, and cost £25, and you can expect shipping dates for kits ordered in through them to be similar to those ordered from Micro Center.",,2022-05-17T03:06:36Z,2025-03-30T13:26:40Z,0,3,3,,0,1
power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/dulanaDias/login-screen,dulanaDias/login-screen,"                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.",,2018-11-09T11:28:40Z,2025-04-19T22:48:16Z,27,3,3,,1,1

Presentation   Goldilocks has officially featured in a couple of an excess of auto audits, yet there's no better approach to say it: The 2015 Nissan Altima is a ""simply right"" family car in many regards. You need efficiency? Both the four-chamber motor and the V6 are class pioneers. Power? Indeed the base four zooms to 60 mph in under 8 seconds. Driving progress?

Check the accident test scores; they're about impeccable no matter how you look at it. No doubt Nissan hasb uilt the ideal auto.   So is there any good reason why you wouldn't purchase an Altima? Actually, for one thing, the consistently variable programmed transmission (CVT) may not be to everybody's preferring. In spite of the fact that it pushes fuel effectiveness, it tends to rev the motor boisterously amid unobtrusive quickening and ""drag"" it at low rpm while cruising - particularly in four-barrel models. Additionally, in the event that you need a secondary lounge that is fabricated for 6-footers, there are better decisions.

The first report was published in 2012 and has since been followed by a report every year. The first report in 2012 presented the available global data on national happiness and reviewed related evidence from emerging science of happiness, showing that the quality of people’s lives can be coherently, reliably and validly assessed by a variety of subjective well-being measures, collectively referred to then and in subsequent reports as “happiness”. Subsequent reports have since included updated evaluations and a range of commissioned chapters on special topics digging deeper into the science of well-being.     Context  The 2019 World Happiness report was the 7th report. It was released on March 20, 2019 and it focused on happiness and community. It was meant to find out how happiness has evolved over the past dozen years with a focus on technologies, social norms, conflicts and government policies that have driven those changes in the 156 countries where the survey was conducted. Owing to the fact that the world is a rapidly changing place, the way people communicate and interact with each other whether in schools or workplaces, their neighborhoods or far places is among the fastest changing aspects. After presenting the 2019 Happiness country ranking, more broadly main forces that influence happiness by changing the ways in which communities interact were considered. Among these was the links between government and happiness, the power of prosocial behavior and the changes in information technology.

This couldn't be truer for the breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves (GW), signals from colliding binary black holes in 2015. It required the collaboration of experts in physics, mathematics, information science, and computing. GW signals have led researchers to observe a new population of massive, stellar-origin black holes, to unlock the mysteries of neutron star mergers, and to measure the expansion of the Universe. These signals are unimaginably tiny ripples in the fabric of space-time and even though the global network of GW detectors are some of the most sensitive instruments on the planet, the signals are buried in detector noise. Analysis of GW data and the detection of these signals is a crucial mission for the growing global network of increasingly sensitive GW detectors. These challenges in data analysis and noise characterization could be solved with the help of data science.  As with the multi-disciplined approach to the discovery of GWs, additional expertise will be needed to further GW research. In particular, social and natural sciences have taken an interest in machine learning, deep learning, classification problems, data mining, and visualization to develop new techniques and algorithms to efficiently handle complex and massive data sets. The increase in computing power and the development of innovative techniques for the rapid analysis of data will be vital to the exciting new field of GW Astronomy. Potential outcomes may include increased sensitivity to GW signals, application to control and feedback systems for next-generation detectors, noise removal, data conditioning tools, and signal characterization.  G2Net is a network of Gravitational Wave, Geophysics and Machine Learning. Via an Action from COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology), a funding agency for research and innovation networks, G2Net aims to create a broad network of scientists. From four different areas of expertise, namely GW physics, Geophysics, Computing Science and Robotics, these scientists have agreed on a common goal of tackling challenges in data analysis and noise characterization for GW detectors.  In this competition, you’ll aim to detect GW signals from the mergers of binary black holes. Specifically, you'll build a model to analyze simulated GW time-series data from a network of Earth-based detectors.   The series of images above were taken from the 2015 paper announcing the discovery of gravitational waves from a pair of merging black holes.  If successful, you'll play a part in solving a crucial mission in the exciting new field of GW science. With the development of new algorithms, scientists will have a better handle on the potential power of the data science community and their innovative approaches to data analysis. Moreover, it will enable closer interaction between computer science and physics, which could benefit both disciplines.

The elements of A and X should be single precision floating-point numbers (float). The elements of A should be initialized so that A[i] = i / 3.0f;   Have your program vary the number of elements in A from 1 Million to  MIN(maximum number that can be supported by single invocation of a GPU kernel, 256 Million) in power of two steps, i.e., 1M, 2M, 4M, 8M, 16M, etc. For every different array size, have your program print three time measurements: the time required to copy A from the CPU to the GPU, the time taken by the kernel, and the time required to copy the data from the GPU to the CPU. Use the event timer calls to measure these intervals. The second assignment is writing a CUDA program that finds the maximum or the minimum among the elements of an array of N integers, and try to optimize the program for speed as much as possible. The third assignment is writing a filter for a BMP image. The image will be provided as a two dimensional array of bytes. Each pixel is represented by three consecutive bytes for three color channels (Red, Green, Blue), each with a value from 0 to 255. To get the blur effect the value of each output pixel will be determined by the corresponding input pixel value plus all neighboring pixel values. The neighboring pixels are the ones that locate within a fixed RADIUS of the target pixel.

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",,2020-02-09T01:43:20Z,2025-04-04T03:31:45Z,0,2,2,,0,0

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.    An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      PM2 Process manager for Node.JS     Copyright (C) 2013-2016 Strzelewicz Alexandre      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a ""Source"" link that leads users to an archive of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary.

power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/Mr033/-1123,Mr033/-1123,"                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.",,2021-11-09T13:05:10Z,2025-04-04T03:31:56Z,14,2,2,,2,0
power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/AkshayYohannan/effective-winner,AkshayYohannan/effective-winner,"When Paul was writing the second letter to Timothy, he summed up the practical purpose of Scripture in the words, ""All Scripture ... is profitable ... that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works"" (2 Tim. 3:16, 17). The greatest vocation under the sun is that of the soul-winner, and we ought to give serious consideration to the preparation for it.  In Great Britain, in every department of life, there is an increasing demand for efficiency. The slacker is in for a hard time, and a man or woman in business or in a profession must be completely furnished for his or her life purpose. Ought we to be content with a lower standard in the service of Christ? I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has a right to demand the very best that we can offer Him, and I am perfectly sure that we shall never be truly yielded in His sight unless we offer to Him all the potentialities of our ransomed personality-body, mind and spirit. You remember what Paul says: ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth"" (2 Tim. 2:15). That was Charles Alexander's watchword, and it is engraved on his tombstone in Birmingham, England: ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God.""  Be Sure of Your Conversion  Let me remind you of a few essentials if you are to be an effective winner of souls. First of all, and needless to say, we must be very sure of our own conversion. And yet, I wonder, is it needless to say it? Two hundred and fifty years ago, Richard Baxter declared, ""Many a preacher is now in hell that hath an hundred times called upon his hearers to use every care and diligence to escape it."" When I first read that I was inclined to think it was an exaggeration, but in the light of further and wider experience, I am inclined to think that Richard Baxter was right. Yes, it is possible to warn men to flee from the wrath to come and yet not to have fled from it oneself.  And then I suggest that we try to keep the freshness and the wonder of our conversion experience. God forbid that we should ever come to regard it as one of the commonplaces of life. A friend of mine years ago whimsically said to me, ""I was converted to God forty years ago, and I never got over it!"" It is a great thing to live with a constant sense of wonder that the grace of God has reached us and saved us.  In the second place, if we are to be effective soul-winners we must have a pure and unselfish motive. We must be ""approved unto God."" That is one of the picturesque expressions of the New Testament. It means being subjected to drastic tests. I found an illustration of that in Saturday's Daily News. Here is a picture of a worker in a foundry taking molten steel from the furnace. From there it goes to the laboratory where it is subjected to the close scrutiny of metallurgical experts. The fire will try every man's work. Study give diligence-says Paul, to be approved unto God—to be bright metal cleansed from every bit of dross, effective for its purpose. Oh, let us beware lest there is any alloy mixed with our motive! Beware of trying to gain a reputation for ourselves as a soul-winner instead of seeking the glory of Christ.  I think the most outrageous example I ever came across was when a man actually advertised himself after this fashion: ""I will gain for you fifteen church members in a week, or I will give you twenty pounds."" Fancy a man making a bet as to how many souls he was going to win for Christ in a week! All reputations of that character are bubbles that will soon burst and disappear. When D. L. Moody was asked upon one occasion how many converts he had made, he answered, ""I don't keep the Lamb's book of life."" We can leave the results to God!  Make Large Use of the Bible  Then, in the third place, we must be men and women of the Book. In the story of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8), three essential things are mentioned: (1) There is an anxious inquirer; (2) there is a copy of the Scriptures; (3) there is a man on the lookout to win a soul for Christ. Philip could have done very little with the eunuch if he had not had a copy of the Scriptures before him. From the Scriptures, Philip ""preached unto him Jesus.""  Have you noticed what a large place the Scriptures occupied in our Lord's ministry? His whole personal life was nourished and built up upon the Word of God. And in all His public work it was to the Word of God that He turned again and again. When He met the tempter in the wilderness, He vanquished him by quotations from the Word of God.  It was the same with the apostles and in the experience of the early Church. What a wonderful regard Peter, Paul, John and the rest of the apostles had for the Scriptures! We might follow on through the whole history of the Church of Christ and find the same thing repeating itself. Some of the mightiest soul-winners were the Puritans. What was the secret of their success? It was because they were men who from morning to night steeped themselves in the Word of God.  I remember reading somewhere that Dr. R. A. Torrey said, ""There are four reasons why every Christian worker should know his Bible: First, to show men their need of a Savior; second, to show them that Jesus is the Savior they need; third, to show them how to make this Savior their Savior; and finally, to deal with specific difficulties that stand in the way of their accepting Christ.""  I suppose you know everything about D. L. Moody in the Institute, but may I remind you how Henry Moorhouse taught Moody this secret? Moorhouse said to him, ""You are making a mistake in giving people your own words. Give them the Word of God, and you will learn the secret of power. "" And about thirty years earlier Robert Murray McCheyne, of Dundee, had said a similar thing: ""It is not our comments upon the Word that bring life; it is the Word itself."" Our comments are like the feathers of an arrow which guide the arrow of the Word to its mark, but it is the Word itself that gets home.  A Personal Testimony  It is a great delight to see so many young faces before me, and it is for their sake in particular that I mention these things. Some of you may say, ""How can I gain this facility in the Word of God? How can I know instantly where to turn for an appropriate passage?"" I suppose there are various methods. I will give you a little bit of my own experience. In my early Christian life I was greatly helped by reading everything I could lay my hands on that D. L. Moody wrote. Later on, Dr. Torrey came on the scene, and I began to read his books. I remember that he brought out what was called The Vest Pocket Companion. It was a very simple arrangement of Scripture verses under various topics so that one could very readily find an appropriate text on a given topic. That book was very useful to me as an inexperienced beginner.  There are others who have adopted the method of underlining specified passages of Scripture with different colored inks: underlining in black references to sin and condemnation; underlining in red references to the death of Christ and the efficacy of the shed blood, and so on. I have not followed that method, but I know others who have found it useful.  But let me say this: Such methods are all right to begin with, but you have not developed much if after ten years of Christian work in soul-winning you are still as dependent upon such aids as you were at the beginning. I am quite sure Dr. Torrey never meant his book to be more than an introduction, a method of guidance in the use of Scripture for the beginner. You ought to become so expert in the Word of God that without even the need of colored inks you can turn to the passage that you know is appropriate to the point under discussion.  Dr. Handley Moule, late Bishop of Durham, used to say that every Christian should know his Bible as much as a Londoner knows his London. London is a huge city, spread out much more than Chicago or New York. I do not know every street, but I know whether a particular district is north or west or south or east. I know the main thoroughfares and many of the side streets, and that is how we ought to be able to know our way about the Scriptures. We ought to know the large areas of the Word of God. We ought to know the theme of every book and the main lines of the history or the argument of an epistle. Whatever method you begin with, aim at least at that, and use all the aids that will enable you to become proficient in the knowledge of the Word of God. Make much use of concordances, as Moody used to urge us to do, and the other helps that in these days are so abundant.  Value of Hard Work  Perhaps you say, ""If I am going to do this, it is going to involve much time and labor. "" Well, my friends, what else do you expect? If you are going to enter trade or industry-if you are going to be a lawyer, a medical man, an army officer or a nurse-in order to become proficient, you have to study hard. You have to live laborious days and pass the most severe examinations and gain a diploma before you even begin your career. As I said at the beginning, there is no higher or more important vocation upon earth than to be a soul-winner. Do you imagine that to save a soul from eternal death is one of the unskilled occupations? Thank God, He can and He does use the humblest and the least instructed believer. The Lord will make you a soul-winner from the beginning if all your heart goes out in desire for the salvation of men and women. But the more you understand the significance of your work, the more you will come to realize that a man who is going to become skilled in the winning of souls is the man who must give diligence to the task and attention to methods by which the Lord can make him more helpful to those in need.  Beware of the man who comes to you and says, ""Never mind about such things. After all, the apostles were untrained men. "" I do not believe that a greater untruth has ever been uttered than that. The apostles attended the finest theological college the world has ever known. For three years they had personal tuition in the things of God by none other than the infallible Son of God Himself. There never was such a college as that in Galilee, when Peter, James and John and the others followed the Lord.  In the New Testament we have recorded for us the lessons that those men were taught, so that as we read the Gospels and ponder the things our Lord said to His disciples and the object lessons He gave them in the miracles, we, too, are attending the Bible school of Christ. And when we read Paul's thirteen epistles, we join the apostle Paul's correspondence school. Yes, we have the same curriculum as the men our Lord commissioned at the first to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.  Value of Bible Training  Though some here may not have opportunity to attend a Bible school, you have the Word of God in your hand, and you have the Spirit, who gave the Word, as the interpreter. Even though you have no other help, yet with the Word itself and prayer and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, you can become wise in the things of Christ.  I have known men who have acquired a liberal education simply because they have steeped themselves in the Bible. Sometimes I have listened to an eloquent message from a simple, unlettered, working man, made eloquent because he has given years to the reading of the Word of God so that it is stored in his memory and has transformed his whole vocabulary. Such is the power of the Word of God to edify and to build up.  Remember also that though we may acquire technical efficiency, yet if we lack a passion for souls, our labor will be in vain. We must see to it that our intellectual training does not outpace our growth in the Spirit. As we seek to know how to find the appropriate Scripture to fit every case, so also we must keep flaming in our hearts the fire of a great love and compassion for those who are perishing. I should like to add:  A Word of Encouragement  We are apt to associate soul-winning with those engaged in pulpit ministry. It may be that I am speaking to some Sunday School teacher, and the thought uppermost in that teacher's mind may be, ""If I could be like some of these world-famed evangelists and preachers; if only I could be used of God and see scores coming out for Christ in the public assembly-then, indeed, I feel that my life would be lived for some purpose. But I cannot speak on the public platform. I can only teach a few children.""  Now, my brother, my sister, remember that you can be as effective a soul-winner where God has placed you as the man who is used by Him to bring about hundreds and thousands of public decisions. Whatever our gifts and whatever our opportunities, we can all have an equal measure, if we will, of the passion for souls. And our special God-given work can be as truly directed to a soul-winning end as that of any other.  Among the books that have been of great inspiration to me in past years is The Life of William Carey. Now I venture to say that when year after year William Carey was toiling at translating the Scriptures into Sanskrit and other languages of the East, his literary labor was as truly directed to a soul-winning purpose and was inspired by as true a passion for souls as was the evangelistic work of D. L. Moody on the public platform. Moody would have been the first to acknowledge that. At the end of his forty years in India, how many souls could Carey reckon he had won directly to Christ through his instrumentality? Nothing like the number Spurgeon or Moody saved from their preaching. But Carey placed the Scriptures in the hands of missionaries and native workers, an how many souls have been won since because of the labor of William Carey to give the Scriptures to the East?  How Christian Businessmen Help  Those splendid businessmen who rallied around D. L. Moody and gave him money to establish his institutions were men who labored in business for the glory of Christ and with a soul-winning purpose. I emphasize this fact for the encouragement of anyone who may imagine that because his own gifts a inconspicuous, therefore, his life is less effective than the lives of others. What value do we attach to a human soul? That is the test by which to examine our lives. If we can move among men who are careless and indifferent, perhaps openly skeptical and unbelieving, and yet not be stirred to the depths of our being, there is something wrong with us. It is so easy to become professional in our work. May God save us from being professional preachers or professional pastors, or professional editors! May God give us fire and passion!  Do we value souls? Oh, that men and women may become impressed with the fact that we are in dead earnest! Bishop Phillips Brooks quoted a man who said to a preacher, ""I am not really convinced by what you say. I am not sure but what I could answer every argument you have presented, but one thing puzzles me and makes me feel that there is power in your message. I cannot understand why you go to so much trouble and why you labor with me in this way, as if you cared for my soul! ""  That is it! Many a skeptic has been won to Christ, not so much by argument as by realizing that the preacher believed what he said. A Jewish millionaire went to the Royal Opera House, London, to hear D. L. Moody. One of his friends said to him, ""You don't believe what he preaches, do you?"" And the reply was to the point, ""No, I don't; but he does. And that is why I go to hear that man.""  Alexander Duff said, ""I would stand on a street comer in India, and I would clap two shoes together if thereby I could claim the attention of the people to the things of Christ."" When, after 25 years in India, Dr. Duff's health broke down and he had to come home, he was so enfeebled that when he addressed the General Assembly, half way through his address he sank down fainting on the platform. As soon as he revived, he said, ""I haven't finished my speech. Take me back again!"" Once more he faced that assembly. This is what he said: ""Mr. Moderator, if it is true that Scotland has no more sons to give to the service of the Lord in India, then old man that I am, having lost my health in that land and having come home to die, I will be off tomorrow to let them know that there is one old Scotsman who is prepared to die for them. Gladly will I lay down my life on the shores of the Ganges, if only I can plead once more with India to come to Christ. "" That is the passion for souls. May God give it to us!",,2022-03-23T15:35:02Z,2024-09-07T10:17:31Z,0,2,2,,0,0
power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/jamesfoster12/effective-winner,jamesfoster12/effective-winner,"The Effective Soul-Winner by Charles C. Cook (1861-19??) When Paul was writing the second letter to Timothy, he summed up the practical purpose of Scripture in the words, ""All Scripture ... is profitable ... that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works"" (2 Tim. 3:16, 17). The greatest vocation under the sun is that of the soul-winner, and we ought to give serious consideration to the preparation for it.  In Great Britain, in every department of life, there is an increasing demand for efficiency. The slacker is in for a hard time, and a man or woman in business or in a profession must be completely furnished for his or her life purpose. Ought we to be content with a lower standard in the service of Christ? I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has a right to demand the very best that we can offer Him, and I am perfectly sure that we shall never be truly yielded in His sight unless we offer to Him all the potentialities of our ransomed personality-body, mind and spirit. You remember what Paul says: ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth"" (2 Tim. 2:15). That was Charles Alexander's watchword, and it is engraved on his tombstone in Birmingham, England: ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God.""  Be Sure of Your Conversion  Let me remind you of a few essentials if you are to be an effective winner of souls. First of all, and needless to say, we must be very sure of our own conversion. And yet, I wonder, is it needless to say it? Two hundred and fifty years ago, Richard Baxter declared, ""Many a preacher is now in hell that hath an hundred times called upon his hearers to use every care and diligence to escape it."" When I first read that I was inclined to think it was an exaggeration, but in the light of further and wider experience, I am inclined to think that Richard Baxter was right. Yes, it is possible to warn men to flee from the wrath to come and yet not to have fled from it oneself.  And then I suggest that we try to keep the freshness and the wonder of our conversion experience. God forbid that we should ever come to regard it as one of the commonplaces of life. A friend of mine years ago whimsically said to me, ""I was converted to God forty years ago, and I never got over it!"" It is a great thing to live with a constant sense of wonder that the grace of God has reached us and saved us.  In the second place, if we are to be effective soul-winners we must have a pure and unselfish motive. We must be ""approved unto God."" That is one of the picturesque expressions of the New Testament. It means being subjected to drastic tests. I found an illustration of that in Saturday's Daily News. Here is a picture of a worker in a foundry taking molten steel from the furnace. From there it goes to the laboratory where it is subjected to the close scrutiny of metallurgical experts. The fire will try every man's work. Study give diligence-says Paul, to be approved unto God—to be bright metal cleansed from every bit of dross, effective for its purpose. Oh, let us beware lest there is any alloy mixed with our motive! Beware of trying to gain a reputation for ourselves as a soul-winner instead of seeking the glory of Christ.  I think the most outrageous example I ever came across was when a man actually advertised himself after this fashion: ""I will gain for you fifteen church members in a week, or I will give you twenty pounds."" Fancy a man making a bet as to how many souls he was going to win for Christ in a week! All reputations of that character are bubbles that will soon burst and disappear. When D. L. Moody was asked upon one occasion how many converts he had made, he answered, ""I don't keep the Lamb's book of life."" We can leave the results to God!  Make Large Use of the Bible  Then, in the third place, we must be men and women of the Book. In the story of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8), three essential things are mentioned: (1) There is an anxious inquirer; (2) there is a copy of the Scriptures; (3) there is a man on the lookout to win a soul for Christ.

A solenoid valve will be used to control the flow of water, which is when energized the water will flow out and when de-energized the water will be stopped, so we will write an Arduino program which always checks if any object is placed near the tap, if yes the solenoid will be turned on and wait till the object is removed, once the object is removed the solenoid will be turned off automatically thus closing the supply of water. The Ultrasonic Sensor is powered by the 5v+ and ground pins of the Arduino. The Echo and Trigger pins is connected to the pin 8 and pin 9 respectively. We can then program the Arduino to use the Ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and turn on air pump when an object is detected. The whole circuit design is simple and hence can be easily build.

Critics of the Lisbon Treaty, such as former Danish MEP Jens-Peter Bonde, argued that it would consolidate the EU and undermine democracy by ""moving power away"" from national electorates.

They're not perfect, but they're close enough to make it worth your time and money. The AirPods Pro cost more than the normal AirPods, and it is not clear why. The only difference between them is that the Pro has a case for protection and better sound quality, which makes sense if you want to use them in public places, but does not make sense if you just want to listen to music at home or in the office.     The first thing that jumps out at you when you take a look at the new Airpods is how tiny they are. Without the charging case, they look like any other pair of headphones, with a single small button on each earbud and a circular power button on their backs. The charging case adds another button on each side, which adds some extra functionality in addition to charging.     That small size makes them easy to wear for hours on end, and the wireless setup means that there's no cable connecting them to your phone or computer (or even any other device). It's just you and your music — which is exactly what we want from our headphones these days.The only downside is that they cost $159, which is more than twice as much as the standard version. But if you can afford it and you really want what Apple's offering here — the best earbuds ever — then go for it.     The first generation of AirPods were released in 2016 and consisted of simple, oval-shaped earbuds that could be clipped into a case to connect them to each other wirelessly. They were well-received, but the design felt like an evolutionary step backward from what we'd seen with Apple's earphones over the years — like a second-generation version of those old wired EarPods that came with every iPhone since 2007.     The new AirPods Pro are different in two major ways: First, they're much bigger and bulkier, thanks to their ability to connect to each other wirelessly through Bluetooth 5 (they still require a cable if you want to go wired). Second, instead of being oval-shaped like their predecessors, these new buds are more like traditional earphones: They have defined edges and a thicker profile that makes them feel less awkward when you aren't wearing them.     But one of the most important features of these new wireless headphones is that they're wireless — meaning you don't have to worry about tangling your cord around your neck or getting them caught on things as you walk around. The first generation of AirPods were fine at staying in your ears but had a few issues: They didn't stay in your ears very well when exercising or dancing, and they could fall out unexpectedly if you moved too much. The second-generation AirPods fixed those problems by adding an accelerometer inside each bud that measures motion when you move around while wearing them so they'll stay put better than before.     Apple has been very good at keeping the AirPod user base up to date with its latest updates. The company has released three iOS updates over a period of six months, each containing various improvements and bug fixes. It also released a new version of the AirPods firmware on May 15th, which contains an option for users to store their preference for the ""Find My AirPods'' feature on the device itself — rather than having it stored in iCloud.     In addition to this, there's been plenty of chatter about improvements in battery life and charging speeds, but not much else. We're still waiting for Apple to release some sort of extended warranty program for its AirPods — something that other manufacturers like Bose and Jabra have already implemented — but hopefully we'll see something soon",,2022-10-03T16:53:59Z,2024-10-20T23:57:52Z,4,1,1,,0,0

power measure is:public archived:false,https://github.com/Kancllo/License,Kancllo/License,"             GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 19 November 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.    A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.    The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.    An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.    ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.    To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.    A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.    A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     ""keep intact all notices"".      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".    A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published     by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or     (at your option) any later version.      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.      You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a ""Source"" link that leads users to an archive of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.",,2021-07-16T23:58:05Z,2025-04-04T03:31:54Z,14,1,1,,0,0

Before purchasing a bunk bed, here are some general guidelines to help you select one the will be safe, comfortable and stylish.   Things to Consider Before Purchasing a Bunk Bed  Bunk beds should be used by children six or older. If one of your children is under six, plan on assigning the bottom bunk to the younger one  The guardrails of the top bunk should be on all four sides. There should be five inches of space from the top of the mattress to the top of the guardrail (of the top bunk). If the mattress is too thick, the guardrail will not be able to protect your child from falling out of bed. Check the manufacturer’s product information for the weight capacity, especially of the top bunk. It should be well-made and constructed of strong and durable materials. It shouldn’t wobble or shake. If your home is prone to uneven floors, plan to use levelers. Many manufacturers include them; if not, they can be purchased at most hardware stores Corners should be rounded. The ladder should be securely fastened and not easily removed by a child. Take into consideration the size and shape of the room you are purchasing the bunk bed for. Measure the available space and make sure that there will at least three feet of clearance between the ceiling and the top bunk. Especially if your child occupying the lower bunk likes to read in bed, ensure that there will be enough space between the bottom and top bunks, so that he or she will be able to sit up comfortably.   Types of Bunk Beds  Most of us will immediately picture the standard style bunk bed for kids as two twin beds, one above the other, made of wood. But today, bunk beds come in a variety of styles and types, with different features such as under-bed storage, a built-in student desk or a trundle bed.  The twin over twin bunk bed, also known as a standard bunk bed, is two twin beds stacked one on top of the other. Most twin over twin bunk beds can be separated into individual, freestanding beds. Twin bunk beds can be made of wood or metal or a combination of wood and metal. They are great space-savers. Even if you’re decorating the room for one child, a twin bunk bed is an ideal way to be prepared for sleepovers or unexpected guests.  The twin over full bunk bed resembles the standard bunk bed, but is designed to accommodate two different mattress sizes, a twin on the top and a full or double mattress on the bottom. This is an ideal configuration if one child requires more room.  The full over full bunk bed is comprised of two full or double sized beds. This type of bunk bed is a real space-saver, doubling the room’s sleeping capacity. A full over full bunk bed would also be ideal for a guest room or when decorating a teen’s bedroom.  The loft bunk bed is available in a variety of combinations. Essentially, it is a top bunk with space underneath for any number of furniture groupings. A loft bunk bed can have a freestanding bed, nightstand and a bookcase or a student desk or futon. They can also be an inclusive unit with a sleeping area, work space and built-in or under-bed storage.  Futon bunk beds have a futon sofa as the bottom bunk with a regular twin bed as the top bunk. A futon bunk bed is not only a great way to decorate a child’s or teen’s room, but, it is also a good choice for decorating a multipurpose room or adding sleeping/seating options to a small home office.  A triple bunk resembles a loft bed, but has two twin bunks on the top, usually in an “L” formation, with the third twin on the bottom. Many types of triple bunk beds are also available in X-long (five inches longer than a standard twin), which makes them a popular choice for a teen’s room or a dorm room.          Bunk Bed Features  Storage drawers are designed to fit underneath the bottom bunk. They can be on casters or be a part of the bunk bed’s structure and slide out, much like a dresser drawer.  The trundle bed fits underneath the unit, and usually accommodates a twin mattress. It can be one of two kinds: resembling a large drawer, it pulls out from under the bottom bunk or it can be a pop-up trundle, which is basically a folding frame designed to hold a twin mattress.  The bottom bunk can be a captain’s bed box, which provides a built-in storage system, usually consisting of drawers, below a sleeping area.  While a ladder is the most popular style, bunk beds with stairs are another option. Many have built-in storage drawers to make the most of the space.   Bunk Bed Style  You want their space to look just as good as the rest of your home. Style is important. But it can’t just look good; it also has to be practical and durable. Select a style of furniture that reflects their interests and who they are, and you will create an environment that will have a lasting appeal.  Inspired by historical periods and their social customs, traditional children’s bedroom furniture can be ornate, with lots of decorative details. Traditional elements include scalloped edges, turned legs and crown molding are popular choices for white bunk beds for girls.  Country furniture has a relaxed, comfortable look and feel. It includes many whimsical decorative details such as stenciling, embossing, and beadboard. Country furniture is typically made of wood and a combination of wood and metal. It has a warm and homey feel that can make a child’s room instantly inviting.  Contemporary children’s furniture typically has simple lines and relaxed ornamentation. A contemporary bunk bed can be made of wood, metal or a combination of wood and metal. With its uncomplicated forms, this style is inviting, while being unpretentious.          Construction Material  Most bunk beds are made of wood, metal or wood and metal. Wood bunk beds can be made of engineered woods (produced from recycled materials) or real wood. Many manufacturers use wood from trees like maple, oak, cherry or pine for the bunk bed frame because of qualities like durability, strength and grain density. Metal beds can be fashioned out of iron, steel, aluminum or other alloys. Metal bunk beds are a popular choice because they have a contemporary appeal, while being easy to care for and maintain.   Bunk Bed Mattresses  Use a standard size (twin, full, etc.) mattress; unless the manufacturer specifies, the depth of the mattress should be no thicker than eight inches, especially for the top bunk. Make sure that it's a snug fit: there should be no gaps between the mattress and the frame. If you are not sure if the weight capacity listed for the bunk bed, especially the top bunk, includes the weight of the mattress, ask for clarification before making a final decision.   Bunkie Boards  Most bunk beds use a type of support system instead of a standard box spring. A bunkie board is a flat, thin platform, usually made of wood, on which the mattress rests. A slat kit consists of strips of wood with spaces in between and is designed to support the mattress without the need of anything else. The bunkie board or slat kit can be included as part of the bunk bed package or are sometimes offered as an accessory item to be purchased separately.  Bunk Bed Safety Tips  Bunk beds are a convenient way to decorate a child’s room, whether they will be sharing the space with a sibling or an overnight guest. Especially when the room is small and you want space for ""extras"" like toys and other neat stuff, the bunk bed can be the ideal space-saver. But is it safe? This is a brief guide that outlines ways to give you peace of mind and keep your children safe and happy when using a bunk bed.  General Bunk Bed Safety Protocol  You can't watch them 24 hours a day, but you can set some ground rules the will reduce the possibility of injury due to a bunk bed accident. Do not purchase a bunk bed for children under six. If you are buying a bunk bed for older children with younger siblings, children under six years old should not be allowed on the upper bunk. Limit the number of children on the top bunk to one or the weight capacity of the top bunk. This is going to be a tough one to enforce, but have a ""no bouncing, no roughhousing"" on the top bunk rule.  Bunk beds must meet specified industry standards. To produce the best product they can make, many manufacturers follow voluntary standards in addition to the standardized ones. When assembling the unit, follow all of the instructions and don't make any modifications or substitutions. Any alterations you make might compromise the safety of the structure, and in most cases will void any warranty offered by the manufacturer.          Safety Standards  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission requires that any bunk bed sold in the United States must meet the following requirements: Have a label that states the manufacturer's name, model number and mattress size information. Have a warning label that advises against placing children under six years of age in the upper bunk. It must have a continuous guardrail on the wall side of bed if the bunk bed is taller than 30 inches. Openings anywhere on the unit, either the upper or lower bunk, must be small enough that a child's head, torso, or limb cannot pass through them.   Guardrails  The top bunk should be protected on all four side to prevent your child from falling out of bed when rolling over in the night. This would include the headboard and footboard, in addition to side rails. Even if you plan on putting the bunk bed against the wall, do not remove the rail; using the full length guardrail will prevent the person on the top bunk from getting trapped between the bed and the wall. The side guardrails should rise at least five inches above the mattress. If the mattress is too high, it renders the guardrail too low and there is a chance your child can fall off the top bunk while sleeping (especially if he or she constantly moves in their sleep). The gap between the bed frame and the bottom of the guardrail should not exceed 3.5 inches. The spaces between the guardrails, whether vertical or horizontal, are also governed by safety standards. They cannot be too wide, eliminating the chance of a child's head becoming wedged in between.   Ladders  The ladder should be well-constructed. It should not be easily detached by a child. It should also be stationary or fixed (not designed to be moved around). The ladder should be used at all times, to get up into bed and down from the bed. Discourage them from using a chair, toy box, etc., sliding down or jumping off the top bunk.   Other Safety Things to Keep in Mind  Particularly for first time bunk bed users, consider installing a nightlight to make it easier to use the ladder safely if they have to get out of bed during the night. When installing the bunk bed, ensure that it is secure and doesn't wobble; if it does, use levelers. Make regular inspections. Check from time to time that all bolts and screws are still tight and nothing has been broken. If it has, repair it or replace it as soon as possible.  Bunk beds are a great space-saving way to decorate a guest room or a child's bedroom, especially if siblings have to share. While manufacturers, agencies and organizations do everything in their power to make them safe, sometimes they aren't. Following these general guidelines will go a long way to keeping your child safe around bunk beds. And as a parent, you can achieve the peace of mind to sleep soundly yourself, knowing that you're doing everything you can to keep your children safe and sound.",,2015-12-22T16:48:12Z,2018-12-13T15:51:13Z,0,1,1,,0,0
